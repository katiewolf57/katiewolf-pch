This poster is from a set of new \"travel posters\" from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, which envision a day when the creativity of scientists and engineers will allow us to do things we can only dream of now.

Further Cassini mission discoveries revealed strong evidence of a global ocean and the first signs of potential hydrothermal activity beyond Earth - making this tiny Saturnian moon one of the leading locations in the search for possible life beyond Earth. This poster is from a set of new \"travel posters\" from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, which envision a day when the creativity of scientists and engineers will allow us to do things",

                "description": "Frigid and alien, yet similar to our own planet billions of years ago, Saturn\u2019s largest moon, Titan, has a thick atmosphere, organic-rich chemistry and a surface shaped by rivers and lakes of liquid ethane and methane. Cold winds sculpt vast regions of hydrocarbon-rich dunes. There may even be cryovolcanoes of cold liquid water. NASA\u2019s Cassini orbiter was designed to peer through Titan\u2019s perpetual haze and unravel the mysteries of this planet-like moon. This poster is from a set of new \"travel posters\" from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, which envision a day when the creativity of scientists and engineers will allow us to do things we can only dream of now. The posters in the set depict various cosmic destinations including Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, Saturn's vapor-spewing moon Enceladus, and the dwarf planet Ceres. You can take a virtual trip to 14 alien worlds, and maybe even plaster your living room with planetary art, via the new, futuristic space tourism posters. The posters are the brainchild of The Studio at JPL, a design and strategy team that works with JPL scientists and engineers to visualize and depict complex science and technology topics. Their work is used in designing space missions and in sharing the work of NASA/JPL with the public. The Archive copy is a high resolution TIFF image that can be downloaded from the digital library and printed 20 x 30 inches in high-resolution.",

The twin spacecraft revealed stunning details about Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - using each planet\u2019s gravity to send them on to the next destination. Voyager set the stage for such ambitious orbiter missions as Galileo to Jupiter and Cassini to Saturn. Today both Voyager spacecraft continue to return valuable science from the far reaches of our solar system. This poster is from a set of new \"travel posters\" from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, which envision a day when the creativity of scientists and engineers will allow us to do things we can only dream of now. The posters in the set depict various cosmic destinations including Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, Saturn's vapor-spewing moon Enceladus, and the dwarf planet Ceres. You can take a virtual trip to 14 alien worlds, and maybe even plaster your living room with planetary art, via the new, futuristic space tourism posters. The posters are the brainchild of The Studio at JPL, a design and strategy team that works with JPL scientists and engineers to visualize and depict complex science and technology topics. Their work is used in designing space missions and in sharing the work of NASA/JPL with the public. The Archive copy is a high resolution TIFF image that can be downloaded from the digital library and printed 20 x 30 inches in high-resolution.",

The twin spacecraft revealed stunning details about Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - using each planet\u2019s gravity to send them on to the next destination. Voyager set the stage for such ambitious orbiter missions as Galileo to Jupiter and Cassini to Saturn. Today both Voyager spacecraft continue to return valuable science from the far reaches of our solar system. This poster is from a set of new \"travel posters\" from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, which envision a day when the creativity of scientists and engineers will allow us to do things we can only dream of now. The posters in the set depict various cosmic destinations including Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, Saturn's vapor-spewing moon Enceladus, and the dwarf planet Ceres. You can take a virtual trip to 14 alien worlds, and maybe even plaster your living room with planetary art, via the new, futuristic space tourism posters. The posters are the brainchild of The Studio at JPL, a design and strategy team that works with JPL scientists and engineers to visualize and depict complex science and technology topics. Their work is used in designing space missions and in sharing the work of NASA/JPL with the public. The Archive copy is a high resolution TIFF image that can be downloaded from the digital library and printed 20 x 30 inches in high-resolution.",

But the discovery indicates that the movie\u2019s iconic double-sunset is anything but science fiction. This poster is from a set of new \"travel posters\" from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, which envision a day when the creativity of scientists and engineers will allow us to do things we can only dream of now. The posters in the set depict various cosmic destinations including Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, Saturn's vapor-spewing moon Enceladus, and the dwarf planet Ceres. You can take a virtual trip to 14 alien worlds, and maybe even plaster your living room with planetary art, via the new, futuristic space tourism posters. The posters are the brainchild of The Studio at JPL, a design and strategy team that works with JPL scientists and engineers to visualize and depict complex science and technology topics. Their work is used in designing space missions and in sharing the work of NASA/JPL with the public.

Depicted here as a terrestrial planet, Kepler-16b might also be a gas giant like Saturn. Prospects for life on this unusual world aren\u2019t good, as it has a temperature similar to that of dry ice. But the discovery indicates that the movie\u2019s iconic double-sunset is anything but science fiction. This poster is from a set of new \"travel posters\" from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, which envision a day when the creativity of scientists and engineers will allow us to do things we can",

Yet, in its thinnest places, the rings are only as tall as a three-story building. Saturn is so far away that it would take six years to get there by space travel; but despite how far away it is from us here on Earth, we can still see parts of its rings from our own planet."

                    "If we had to guess, we\u0092d say you\u0092re reading this from somewhere on planet Earth. The ancient Greeks used the word \u0093planet\u0094, which means wanderer, to describe the huge objects they saw in the sky because they appear to move while the stars in the background appear to stand still. While now we know that everything is moving, including the stars, the name \u0093planet\u0094 stuck with us. According to how scientists define the term, there are eight planets in oursolar system, meaning, objects that orbitthe Sun. The sun uses gravity to keep the planets spinning in orbit, and it also provides heat and light to each of them. The four inner planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Composed of mostly rock and metal and with solid surfaces, these are given the term \u0093terrestiral\u0094 or Earth-like. The four outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are all much larger than the inner planets; Jupiter is larger than the seven other planets combined! In addition to their size, they also differ from the inner planets in that they have no solid surfaces; they are made of liquid and gases, and they each have a ring system and several moons. Not such a small world, after all."

The ancient Greeks used the word \u0093planet\u0094, which means wanderer, to describe the huge objects they saw in the sky because they appear to move while the stars in the background appear to stand still. While now we know that everything is moving, including the stars, the name \u0093planet\u0094 stuck with us. According to how scientists define the term, there are eight planets in oursolar system, meaning, objects that orbitthe Sun. The sun uses gravity to keep the planets spinning in orbit, and it also provides heat and light to each of them. The four inner planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Composed of mostly rock and metal and with solid surfaces, these are given the term \u0093terrestiral\u0094 or Earth-like. The four outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are all much larger than the inner planets; Jupiter is larger than the seven other planets combined! In addition to their size, they also differ from the inner planets in that they have no solid surfaces; they are made of liquid and gases, and they each have a ring system and several moons. Not such a small world, after all.",

                    "This box contained a space robot toy, a tin toy manufactured in Japan for export to Western markets. In the 1950s and 1960s, its maker, Nomura, specialized in producing robot-themed metal toys, including several versions of an unlicensed \"Robby\" robot based on the popular robot character from the film \"Forbidden Planet\" (MGM, 1956). In post-WWII Japan, producing these metal toys began as a way to tap into an international market for \"penny toys\" or cheap playthings, but developed by the late 1950s into a industry manufacturing creatively-designed, complex toys with moving parts and lights that competed successfully with Western toymakers. The artist's depiction of the toy inside dramatizes the toy, showing a metal-clawed robot standing on an outer space landscape with Saturn hanging above.",

In the 1950s and 1960s, its maker, Nomura, specialized in producing robot-themed metal toys, including several versions of an unlicensed \"Robby\" robot based on the popular robot character from the film \"Forbidden Planet\" (MGM, 1956). In post-WWII Japan, producing these metal toys began as a way to tap into an international market for \"penny toys\" or cheap playthings, but developed by the late 1950s into a industry manufacturing creatively-designed, complex toys with moving parts and lights that competed successfully with Western toymakers. The artist's depiction of the toy inside dramatizes the toy, showing a metal-clawed robot standing on an outer space landscape with Saturn hanging above.",

It was acquired by NASM in 1977 and placed on display in the Exploring the Planets gallery shortly thereafter. In 1987, JPL removed the DTM bus for use in developing the Magellan Venus spacecraft, which was similar in design, and replaced it with a facsimile.",
                    "The Voyager program was conceived in the mid-1960's as a mission to explore the outer planets using Mariner-style spacecraft. Officially, the original objective to investigate all of the outer planets in a \"grand tour\" was scaled back to Jupiter and Saturn exclusively due to budgetary cut-backs. However, Voyager 2 was launched on August 20, 1977 and placed on a slow flight path to Jupiter. Subsequently, Voyager 1 was launched on September 5, 1977 and arrived at Jupiter first in March 1979 and Saturn in November 1980. Because Saturn's moon, Titan, is the only other planet with a predominately nitrogen atmosphere, Voyager 1's trajectory was designed to pass within 2550 miles. This manuever caused the flight path to leave the ecliptic plane and out of the Solar System. Voyager 2 encounter Jupiter in July 1979 and Saturn in August 1981. Its slower flight path was designed to allow it to go on to Uranus in January 1986 and then to Neptune in August 1989 as the funding became available to continue the mission.",
                    "The Voyager TV cameras, ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers, and photopolarimeter are mounted on a scan platform that is stabilized about two axes of rotation. These instruments can be pointed with and accuracy of better than one-tenth of a degree. Because the spacecraft travel at speeds in excess of 35,000 mph, and the light levels at Neptune can be 900 times fainter than those on Earth, the spacecraft angular rates were programmed to extremely small to prevent smearing.",
                    "Voyager was the little spacecraft that could.\"-Edward Stone, Voyager Chief Scientist, Jet Propulsion Laboratory",
                    "Voyager",
                    "In the 1970s, NASA's leadership conceived their most daring planetary science expedition, Voyager. It took advantage of a rare astronomical event. Once every 176 years, the giant planets on the outer reaches of the solar system all gather on one side of the sun, and such a configuration was due to occur in the late 1970s. This geometric lineup made possible in a single flight close-up observation of all the planets in the outer solar system (with the exception of Pluto), the \"Grand Tour.\" This planetary alignment offered a crucial advantage: As the spacecraft passed each planet, gravity would bend its flight path and increase its velocity enough to deliver it to the next destination. Known as \"gravity assist,\" this complex process gave the spacecraft a \"slingshot\" boost at each planet. Neptune, the outermost planet in the mission, thus could be reached in 12 rather than 30 years.",
                    "In 1964 NASA conceived Pioneer 10 and 11, the first probes to explore the solar system beyond Mars, and these became the precursors of the Grand Tour of Voyager. Severe budgetary constraints hampered the projects, delaying their launch until 1972 and 1973, respectively Pioneer 10 and 11 yielded invaluable science, Designed to last for 30 months, they performed for more than 20 years, returning useful data on Jupiter and Saturn, as well as providing our first look beyond the solar system at interstellar space.",
                    "Voyager stood as a greater challenge. A four-planet \"grand tour\" was theoretically possible. But design was crucial. A single spacecraft might accomplish the mission, but would have to be extraordinarily complex and expensive to travel to the outer reaches of the solar system, endure for more than a decade, and reliably operate a range of scientific instruments. To simplify the mission and limit the expense, the mission relied on two Voyager spacecraft to conduct intensive flyby studies only of Jupiter and Saturn-in effect repeating on a more elaborate scale the flights of the two Pioneers. With an $865 million budget, engineers designed the two Voyagers to conduct as much science and to last as long as possible. Launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Voyager 2 lifted off on August 20, 1977 and Voyager 1 on September 5, 1977, each taking different trajectories to the outer planets.",
                    "By December 1980, the two Voyager spacecraft had accomplished successfully their objectives at Jupiter and Saturn. Flybys of the two outermost giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, proved possible-and irresistible-to mission scientists. As the two spacecraft flew across the solar system, scientists re-programmed them via radio communications to aim for the outer planets. Eventually Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 explored all the giant outer planets, including their unique systems of rings and magnetic fields, as well as 48 of their moons.",
                    "The two spacecraft returned information to Earth that revolutionized planetary science, helping resolve some key questions while raising intriguing new ones about the origin and evolution of the solar system. For example, although astronomers had studied Jupiter through telescopes on Earth for centuries, scientists were surprised by many of the Voyager findings. It revealed that the Great Red Spot was a complex storm moving in a counterclockwise direction. Easily the greatest unexpected discovery at Jupiter, scientists also found active volcanism on the satellite Io, the first time active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the solar system. Together, the two Voyagers observed the eruption of nine volcanoes on Io, and there is evidence that other eruptions occurred between the Voyager encounters. It discovered that plumes from the volcanoes extend to more than 190 miles above the surface. Io's volcanoes result from heating through tidal pumping between Jupiter and other moons.",
                    "The two Voyagers took well over 100,000 images of the outer planets, rings, and satellites, as well as millions of magnetic, chemical spectra, and radiation measurements. They discovered rings around Jupiter, shepherding satellites in Saturn's rings, new moons around Uranus and Neptune, and geysers on Triton. The last imaging sequence was Voyager 1's portrait of most of the solar system, showing Earth and six other planets as sparks in a dark sky lit by a single bright star, the Sun. In the first decade of the twenty-first century Voyager 1 continued to provide important scientific data about the heliopause, the outer limits of the Sun's magnetic field and outward flow of the solar wind.",

However, Voyager 2 was launched on August 20, 1977 and placed on a slow flight path to Jupiter. Subsequently, Voyager 1 was launched on September 5, 1977 and arrived at Jupiter first in March 1979 and Saturn in November 1980. Because Saturn's moon, Titan, is the only other planet with a predominately nitrogen atmosphere, Voyager 1's trajectory was designed to pass within 2550 miles. This manuever caused the flight path to leave the ecliptic plane and out of the Solar System. Voyager 2 encounter Jupiter in July 1979 and Saturn in August 1981. Its slower flight path was designed to allow it to go on to Uranus in January 1986 and then to Neptune in August 1989 as the funding became available to continue the mission.",

Once every 176 years, the giant planets on the outer reaches of the solar system all gather on one side of the sun, and such a configuration was due to occur in the late 1970s. This geometric lineup made possible in a single flight close-up observation of all the planets in the outer solar system (with the exception of Pluto), the \"Grand Tour.\" This planetary alignment offered a crucial advantage: As the spacecraft passed each planet, gravity would bend its flight path and increase its velocity enough to deliver it to the next destination. Known as \"gravity assist,\" this complex process gave the spacecraft a \"slingshot\" boost at each planet. Neptune, the outermost planet in the mission, thus could be reached in 12 rather than 30 years.",

A single spacecraft might accomplish the mission, but would have to be extraordinarily complex and expensive to travel to the outer reaches of the solar system, endure for more than a decade, and reliably operate a range of scientific instruments. To simplify the mission and limit the expense, the mission relied on two Voyager spacecraft to conduct intensive flyby studies only of Jupiter and Saturn-in effect repeating on a more elaborate scale the flights of the two Pioneers. With an $865 million budget, engineers designed the two Voyagers to conduct as much science and to last as long as possible. Launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Voyager 2 lifted off on August 20, 1977 and Voyager 1 on September 5, 1977, each taking different trajectories to the outer planets.",

Easily the greatest unexpected discovery at Jupiter, scientists also found active volcanism on the satellite Io, the first time active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the solar system. Together, the two Voyagers observed the eruption of nine volcanoes on Io, and there is evidence that other eruptions occurred between the Voyager encounters.

Crider used slides to teach his students as he lectured. The class saw a slide of Galileo\u2019s first stretch of moons of Jupiter. Crider spoke of Saturn, we learned, had rings. Jupiter had moons. That nebulous patch across the center of the sky called the Milky Way was not a cloud but a collection of countless stars. Crider spoke of the Hubble Telescope that discovered galaxies beyond our own.

                    "For over 30 years, the Pioneer 10 spacecraft sent photographs and scientific information back to Earth. Launched March 2, 1972, it reached speeds of 52,100 kilometers (32,400 miles) per hour on its flight to Jupiter, making it one of the fastest human-made objects ever. After completing an investigation of Jupiter, Pioneer 10 continued on to the outer regions of the solar system, studying solar wind and cosmic rays.",
                    "Having gone further into space than any other object sent from Earth, Pioneer's last weak signal was received on January 22, 2003, from approximately 12.2 billion kilometers (7.6 billion miles) from Earth. NASA engineers reported that Pioneer 10's radioisotope power source had degraded and was not likely to allow future transmissions.",
                    "As it drifts into interstellar space, Pioneer 10 will continue to carry a plaque designed to inform intelligent life that may find it about the spacecraft and its origins. The prototype spacecraft displayed here was constructed for NASA by TRW, Inc.",
                    "During the latter 1960s, G.A. Flandro, a JPL scientist, discovered that once every 176 years both the Earth and all the giant planets of the Solar System gather on one side of the Sun. This geometric line-up made possible close\u2011up observation of all the planets in the outer solar system (with the exception of Pluto) in a single flight, the \"Grand Tour.\" The flyby of each planet would bend the spacecraft's flight path and increase its velocity enough to deliver it to the next destination. This would occur through a complicated process known as \"gravity assist,\" something like a slingshot effect, whereby the flight time to Neptune could be reduced from 30 to 12 years. Such a configuration was due to occur in the late 1970s, and it led to one of the most significant space probe efforts undertaken by the U.S.",
                    "To prepare the way for the \"Grand Tour,\" NASA conceived Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 as outer solar system probes. Both were small, nuclear\u2011powered, spin\u2011stabilized spacecraft that Atlas\u2011Centaur launched. The first of these was launched on 3 March 1972, and encountered Jupiter in early December 1973. On 22 January 2003, when Pioneer 10\u2019s signal was last detected, the spacecraft had travelled 82 AU (7.6 billion miles) from Earth, more than twice the distance from the Sun to Pluto. In 1973, NASA launched Pioneer 11, providing scientists with their closest view of Jupiter, from 26,600 miles above the cloud tops in December 1974. The close approach accelerated the spacecraft's speed to 107,373 mph, by far the fastest ever reached by a an object from Earth, and hurled Pioneer 11 1.5\u2011billion miles across the Solar System toward Saturn.",

This geometric line-up made possible close\u2011up observation of all the planets in the outer solar system (with the exception of Pluto) in a single flight, the \"Grand Tour.\" The flyby of each planet would bend the spacecraft's flight path and increase its velocity enough to deliver it to the next destination. This would occur through a complicated process known as \"gravity assist,\" something like a slingshot effect, whereby the flight time to Neptune could be reduced from 30 to 12 years. Such a configuration was due to occur in the late 1970s, and it led to one of the most significant space probe efforts undertaken by the U.S.",

The first of these was launched on 3 March 1972, and encountered Jupiter in early December 1973. On 22 January 2003, when Pioneer 10\u2019s signal was last detected, the spacecraft had travelled 82 AU (7.6 billion miles) from Earth, more than twice the distance from the Sun to Pluto. In 1973, NASA launched Pioneer 11, providing scientists with their closest view of Jupiter, from 26,600 miles above the cloud tops in December 1974. The close approach accelerated the spacecraft's speed to 107,373 mph, by far the fastest ever reached by a an object from Earth, and hurled Pioneer 11 1.5\u2011billion miles across the Solar System toward Saturn.",

Surrounding the left eye of the frontal face, a square shows a small section of the man's face in full color. Behind the figure, horizontal yellow, red, and blue lines recede to the horizon. Dotted white lines emerge from the man's eyes, the ones at center pointing up towards an array of colorful graphics. At top, printed white text: UNDERSTANDING TAXES '79; below, a curving group of images including the American flag; a portrait of Abraham Lincoln; the planet Saturn; a portrait of Franklin Delano Roosevelt; a hand holding a Social Security card; a silver dollar coin, a purple hot-air balloon with the yellow label \"W-2\"; the central oval medallion of a one-dollar bill, the number\"1\" inside; a purple rose; a hand holding a card printed with \"APRIL 15\" in black block letters; a white line drawing similar to a plug or nuclear radiation symbol, and a white dove carrying a sheet with \"1040-A\" printed in orange in its beak.

Surrounding the left eye of the frontal face, a square shows a small section of the man's face in full color. Behind the figure, horizontal yellow, red, and blue lines recede to the horizon. Dotted white lines emerge from the man's eyes, the ones at center pointing up towards an array of colorful graphics. At top, printed white text: UNDERSTANDING TAXES '79; below, a curving group of images including the American flag; a portrait of Abraham Lincoln; the planet Saturn; a portrait of Franklin Delano Roosevelt; a hand holding a Social Security card; a silver dollar coin, a purple hot-air balloon with the yellow label \"W-2\"; the central oval medallion of a one-dollar bill, the number\"1\" inside; a purple rose; a hand holding a card printed with \"APRIL 15\" in black block letters; a white line drawing similar to a plug or nuclear radiation symbol, and a white dove carrying a sheet with \"1040-A\" printed in orange in its beak. Below these icons, a curving row of purple question marks. Centered below, the earth printed in turquoise. Composition contained within white framing line.",
