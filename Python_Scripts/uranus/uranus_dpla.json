The planets Neptune and Uranus were still called Le Verrier and Hershel, and Pluto hadn\u0092t even been discovered as the 9th planet or reclassified as a dwarf planet yet! Though some things have changed since this map was made, the planets are still as far away today as they were then. To measure these distances, scientists use a unit of measurement called a light-year, which is the distance that light travels in one year that equals 9.4607 x 10^12 kilometers or nearly 6 trillion miles! The other planets and the sun are much closer to Earth. The sun is only .000158 light-years away, and Pluto is only .000793 light-years away. Currently, most of the possibly habitable planets outside the solar system that scientists have discovered are up to 300 million light-years away. Although some, like planet Kepler 22-b, are even further out at 600 light-years or 3 and a half quadrillion miles from Earth!"

The planets Neptune and Uranus were still called Le Verrier and Hershel, and Pluto hadn\u0092t even been discovered as the 9th planet or reclassified as a dwarf planet yet! Though some things have changed since this map was made, the planets are still as far away today as they were then. To measure these distances, scientists use a unit of measurement called a light-year, which is the distance that light travels in one year that equals 9.4607 x 10^12 kilometers or nearly 6 trillion miles! The other planets and the sun are much closer to Earth. The sun is only .000158 light-years away, and Pluto is only .000793 light-years away. Currently, most of the possibly habitable planets outside the solar system that scientists have discovered are up to 300 million light-years away. Although some, like planet Kepler 22-b, are even further out at 600 light-years or 3 and a half quadrillion miles from Earth!",

                    "William Herschel (1738-1822), a musician from Hamburg, Germany, moved to England and settled in Bath. There he scanned the skies with a series of reflecting telescopes that were built by him or under his supervision. He became famous for having found the first telescopic planet, which he called Georgium Sidus and others called Uranus. This half-length portrait of Herschel is a stipple engraving by James Godby (active 1790-1815) after a painting by Friedrick Rehberg (1758-1835). Rehberg, a Hanoverian portrait and historical painter, worked in England in 1813 and 1814. The engraving was available from Colnaghi & Co., an important art emporium in London that is still in business.",

This half-length portrait of Herschel is a stipple engraving by James Godby (active 1790-1815) after a painting by Friedrick Rehberg (1758-1835). Rehberg, a Hanoverian portrait and historical painter, worked in England in 1813 and 1814.
