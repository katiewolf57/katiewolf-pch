This poster is from a set of new &quot;travel posters&quot; from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, which envision a day when the creativity of scientists and engineers will allow us to do things we can only dream of now. The posters in the set depict various cosmic destinations including Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, Saturn's vapor-spewing moon Enceladus, and the dwarf planet Ceres. You can take a virtual trip to 14 alien worlds, and maybe even plaster your living room with planetary art, via the new, futuristic space tourism posters. The posters are the brainchild of The Studio at JPL, a design and strategy team that works with JPL scientists and engineers to visualize and depict complex science and technology topics. Their work is used in designing space missions and in sharing the work of NASA/JPL with the public. The Archive copy is a high resolution TIFF image that can be downloaded from the digital library and printed 20 x 30 inches in high-resolution.\n        </description>\n        <subject>Space tourism</subject>\n        <subject>Outer planets</subject>\n        <subject>Exploration of Jupiter (Planet)</subject>\n        <subject>Exploration of Uranus (Planet)</subject>\n        <subject>Exploration of Saturn (Planet)</subject>\n        <subject>Interplanetary voyages</subject>\n        <subject>Space travelers</subject>\n        <subject>Jupiter (Planet)</subject>\n        <subject>Neptune (Planet)</subject>\n        <subject>Saturn (Planet)</subject>\n        <subject>Exploration of Neptune (Planet)</subject>\n        <subject>Uranus (Planet)</subject>\n        <subject>Planets--Exploration</subject>\n        <subject>Recreation and tourism</subject>\n        <subject>Industry and technology</subject>\n        <sourceid>digcoll_usl_22</sourceid>\n        <recordid>digcoll_usl_22library2_lib/81565</recordid>\n        <creationdate>2016</creationdate>\n        <addtitle>Is part of: U.S. Federal Publications</addtitle>\n        <addtitle>Has part: NASA Visions of the Future</addtitle>\n        <addtitle>\n          Visions of the future posters;

                    "NASA\u2019s Voyager mission took advantage of a once-every-175-year alignment of the outer planets for a grand tour of the solar system. The twin spacecraft revealed stunning details about Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - using each planet\u2019s gravity to send them on to the next destination. Voyager set the stage for such ambitious orbiter missions as Galileo to Jupiter and Cassini to Saturn. Today both Voyager spacecraft continue to return valuable science from the far reaches of our solar system. This poster is from a set of new \"travel posters\" from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, which envision a day when the creativity of scientists and engineers will allow us to do things we can only dream of now. The posters in the set depict various cosmic destinations including Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, Saturn's vapor-spewing moon Enceladus, and the dwarf planet Ceres. You can take a virtual trip to 14 alien worlds, and maybe even plaster your living room wi"

The planets Neptune and Uranus were still called Le Verrier and Hershel, and Pluto hadn\u0092t even been discovered as the 9th planet or reclassified as a dwarf planet yet! Though some things have changed since this map was made, the planets are still as far away today as they were then. To measure these distances, scientists use a unit of measurement called a light-year, which is the distance that light travels in one year that equals 9.4607 x 10^12 kilometers or nearly 6 trillion miles! The other planets and the sun are much closer to Earth. The sun is only .000158 light-years away, and Pluto is only .000793 light-years away. Currently, most of the possibly habitable planets outside the solar system that scientists have discovered are up to 300 million light-years away. Although some, like planet Kepler 22-b, are even further out at 600 light-years or 3 and a half quadrillion miles from Earth!"

The planets Neptune and Uranus were still called Le Verrier and Hershel, and Pluto hadn\u0092t even been discovered as the 9th planet or reclassified as a dwarf planet yet! Though some things have changed since this map was made, the planets are still as far away today as they were then. To measure these distances, scientists use a unit of measurement called a light-year, which is the distance that light travels in one year that equals 9.4607 x 10^12 kilometers or nearly 6 trillion miles! The other planets and the sun are much closer to Earth. The sun is only .000158 light-years away, and Pluto is only .000793 light-years away. Currently, most of the possibly habitable planets outside the solar system that scientists have discovered are up to 300 million light-years away. Although some, like planet Kepler 22-b, are even further out at 600 light-years or 3 and a half quadrillion miles from Earth!",

The ancient Greeks used the word \u0093planet\u0094, which means wanderer, to describe the huge objects they saw in the sky because they appear to move while the stars in the background appear to stand still. While now we know that everything is moving, including the stars, the name \u0093planet\u0094 stuck with us. According to how scientists define the term, there are eight planets in oursolar system, meaning, objects that orbitthe Sun. The sun uses gravity to keep the planets spinning in orbit, and it also provides heat and light to each of them. The four inner planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Composed of mostly rock and metal and with solid surfaces, these are given the term \u0093terrestiral\u0094 or Earth-like. The four outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are all much larger than the inner planets; Jupiter is larger than the seven other planets combined! In addition to their size, they also differ from the inner planets in that they have no solid surfaces; they are made of liquid and gases, and they each have a ring system and several moons.

                    "William Herschel (1738-1822), a musician from Hamburg, Germany, moved to England and settled in Bath. There he scanned the skies with a series of reflecting telescopes that were built by him or under his supervision. He became famous for having found the first telescopic planet, which he called Georgium Sidus and others called Uranus. This half-length portrait of Herschel is a stipple engraving by James Godby (active 1790-1815) after a painting by Friedrick Rehberg (1758-1835). Rehberg, a Hanoverian portrait and historical painter, worked in England in 1813 and 1814. The engraving was available from Colnaghi & Co., an important art emporium in London that is still in business.",
