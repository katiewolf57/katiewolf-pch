                            "description": "These two pictures of Uranus -- one in true color (left) and the other in false color -- were compiled from images returned Jan. 17, 1986, by the narrow-angle camera of Voyager 2. The spacecraft was 9.1 million kilometers (5.7 million miles) from the planet, several days from closest approach. The picture at left has been processed to show Uranus as human eyes would see it from the vantage point of the spacecraft. The picture is a composite of images taken through blue, green and orange filters. The darker shadings at the upper right of the disk correspond to the day-night boundary on the planet. Beyond this boundary lies the hidden northern hemisphere of Uranus, which currently remains in total darkness as the planet rotates. The blue-green color results from the absorption of red light by methane gas in Uranus' deep, cold and remarkably clear atmosphere. The picture at right uses false color and extreme contrast enhancement to bring out subtle details in the polar region of Uranus. Images obtained through ultraviolet, violet and orange filters were respectively converted to the same blue, green and red colors used to produce the picture at left. The very slight contrasts visible in true color are greatly exaggerated here. In this false-color picture, Uranus reveals a dark polar hood surrounded by a series of progressively lighter concentric bands. One possible explanation is that a brownish haze or smog, concentrated over the pole, is arranged into bands by zonal motions of the upper atmosphere. The bright orange and yellow strip at the lower edge of the planet's limb is an artifact of the image enhancement. In fact, the limb is dark and uniform in color around the planet.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00032",

Ever since Voyager 2 beamed home spectacular images of the planets in the 1980s, planet-lovers have been hooked on auroras on other planets. Auroras are caused by streams of charged particles like electrons that come from various origins such as solar winds, the planetary ionosphere, and moon volcanism. They become caught in powerful magnetic fields and are channeled into the upper atmosphere, where their interactions with gas particles, such as oxygen or nitrogen, set off spectacular bursts of light.  The auroras on Jupiter and Saturn are well-studied, but not much is known about the auroras of the giant ice planet Uranus. In 2011, the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope became the first Earth-based telescope to snap an image of the auroras on Uranus. In 2012 and 2014 a team led by an astronomer from Paris Observatory took a second look at the auroras using the ultraviolet capabilities of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) installed on Hubble.  They tracked the interplanetary shocks caused by two powerful bursts of solar wind traveling from the sun to Uranus, then used Hubble to capture their effect on Uranus\u2019 auroras \u2014 and found themselves observing the most intense auroras ever seen on the planet. By watching the auroras over time, they collected the first direct evidence that these powerful shimmering regions rotate with the planet. They also re-discovered Uranus\u2019 long-lost magnetic poles, which were lost shortly after their discovery by Voyager 2 in 1986 due to uncertainties in measurements and the featureless planet surface.

Uranus is a pale blue in this natural color image because its visible atmosphere contains methane gas and few aerosols or clouds. Methane on Uranus -- and its sapphire-colored sibling, Neptune -- absorbs red wavelengths of incoming sunlight, but allows blue wavelengths to escape back into space, resulting in the predominantly bluish color seen here. Cassini imaging scientists combined red, green and blue spectral filter images to create a final image that represents what human eyes might see from the vantage point of the spacecraft.  Uranus has been brightened by a factor of 4.5 to make it more easily visible. The outer portion of Saturn's A ring, seen at bottom right, has been brightened by a factor of two. The bright ring cutting across the image center is Saturn's narrow F ring.  Uranus was approximately 28.6 astronomical units from Cassini and Saturn when this view was obtained. An astronomical unit is the average distance from Earth to the sun, equal to 93,000,000 miles (150,000,000 kilometers).  This view was acquired by the Cassini narrow-angle camera at a distance of approximately 614,300 miles (988,600 kilometers) from Saturn on April 11, 2014. Image scale at Uranus is approximately 16,000 miles (25,700 kilometers) per pixel. Image scale at Saturn's rings is approximately 4 miles (6 kilometers) per pixel. In the image, the disk of Uranus is just barely resolved. The solar phase angle at Uranus, seen from Cassini, is 11.9 degrees.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17178",

( 90 mi. ) P-29539C This Voyager 2 image of Uranus was captured as the spacecraft was leaving Uranus behind on its cruise to Neptune. The image is a color composite of three photographs taken through blue, grren, and orange filters. Thin thin crecent seen here is at an angle of 153 degrees between the the spacecraft, the planet, and the sun. Even at this extreme angle, uranus retains the pale blue-green color seen  by the ground based astronomers and recorded by Voyager 2 during its historic encounter, this color results from the presence of methane in Uranus' atmosphere. The gas absorbs red wavelengths of light, leaving the predominant hue seen here. The tendency for the cresent to become white at the extreme edge is cased by the presence of a high-altitude haze. Voyager 2, having encountered Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981, and Uranus in 1986, will proceed on its jouney to Neptune. Closest approach is scheduled for August 24, 1989.",

The next three in toward Uranus, called Delta, Gamma, and Eta, are much fainter and more narrow than Epsilon ring. Then come Beta and Alpha rings, and finally, the innermost grouping, known simply as the 4,5, & 6 rings. The last three are very faint and are at the limit of detection for the Voyager camera. Uranus' rings range in width from about 100 km. (60 mi.) at the widest part of the Epsilon ring, to only a few kilometers for most of the others. this iamge was processed to enhance narrow features; the bright dots are imperfections on the camera detector.

The picture is a composite of images obtained through the single orange and two methane filters of Voyager's wide angle camera. Orange, short wavelength and long wavelength methane images are displayed, retrospectively, as blue, green, and orange. The pink area centered on the pole is due to the presence of hazes high in the atmosphere that reflect the light before it has traversed a long enough path through the atmosphere to suffer absorbtion by methane gas. The bluest region at mid-latitude represent the most haze free regions on Uranus, thus, deeper cloud levels can be detected in these areas.",

At this range, clouds and other features in the atmosphere as small as 1,370 km. could be detected by Voyager 2. Yet, no such features are visible.  This view is toward the illuminated south pole of Uranus. The predominant blue color is the result of atmospheric methane, which absorbs the red wavelengths  from incoming sunlight. The spot at the upper left edge of the planet's disk reulted from the removal of a reseau mark used in making measurments on the photograph. Three of Uranus' five known satellites are visible; Miranda ( at far right, closest to the planet ), Ariel ( next out , at top), and Umbriel ( lower left ). Titania and Oberon are now outside the narrow angle camera's field of view when it centered on the planet.

Umbriel is characterized by the darkest surface and smallest brightness variations of any of the large satellites of Uranus. As seen here, the surface is also generally gray and colorless. Nevertheless, at this resolution, considerable topographic detail is revealed, showing that Umbriel's surface is covered by impact craters. The brightest spot (shown at top near the equator at approxiamately 270 \u00c2\u00b0 longitude) appears as a bright ring. Its geological significance is not yet understood. Umbriel has a diameter of about 1,200 km (750 miles) and orbits 267,000 km (166,000 mi) from Uranus' center. The satellite's name, from Alexander Pope's 'Rape of the Lock,' means 'dark angel'.",

The picture at left has been processed  to show Uranus as the human eye would see from the vantage point of the spacecraft. The image is a composite of shots taken through blue, green, and orange filters. The darker shadings on the upper right of the disk correspond to day-night boundaries on the planet. Beyond this boundary lies the hidden northern hemisphere of Uranus, which currently remains in total darkness as the planet rotates. The blue-green color results from the aborption of red light  by methane gas  in Uranus' deep, cold, and remarkably clear atmosphere. The picture at right uses false color and extreme contrast to bring out subtle details in the polar region of Uranus. Images obtained through ultraviolet, violet, and orange filters were respectively converted to the same  blue, green, and red colors used to produce the picture at left. The very slight contrasts visible in true color are greatly exaggerated here. In this false colr picture, Uranus reveals a dark polar hood surrounded by aseries of progressively lighter concentric bands. One possible explanation is that a brownish haze or smog, concentrated around the pole, is arranged into bands of zonal motions of the upper atmosphere. Several artifacts of the optics and processing are visible. The occasional donut shapes are shadows cast by dust in the camera optics;the processing needed to bring ot faint features also bring out camera blemishes. in addition, the bright pink strip at the lower edge of the planets limb is an artifact of the image enhancement. In fact, the limb is dark and uniform in color around the planet.",

( 22 million miles ) P-29426B/W This Voyager 2 photograph of Uranus shows the is the  first picture to show clear evidence of latitudinal banding in the planet's atmosphere.  This is a computerized summation of five images shot by the narrow angle camera. The concentric pattern emanates like a bulls-eye from the planets pole of rotation, which, in this view, lies left of center. uranus lies almost on its side with respect to the other planets  and is rotating in a counter clockwise direction, as seen here. Clouds in the Uranian atmosphere give rise to the pattern, the first clear evidence of banding similiar to that seen previosly on Saturn and Jupiter. The bandind on Uranus, however, shows much less contrast. At the distance at which the images were acquired, Voyager's camera could have detected individual features as small as 660 km. (410 miles) across, but no such cloud or markings  were apparent. Scientists cannot yet say what properties, such as cloud height, composition, or particle size, are giving rise to the varying levels of brightness visible here. The images composing this picture  were shot through a filter that transmits only violet light. in the original, unprocessed images, the contrast of features  producing the banding is low, not more than 10 percent. In order to reduce 'noise' and enhance the visiblity of the features, processors  combined five images  and then compared the resulting  composite to a hypothetical featureless planet illuminated  by the Sun from  the proper direction. Only the ratio between the original data and the hypothetical image is shown.",

The two main rings, about 53,000 km (33,000 miles) and 63,000 km (39,000 miles) from Neptune, are 5 to 10 times brighter than in earlier images. The difference is due to lighting and viewing geometry. In approach images, the rings were seen in light scattered backward toward the spacecraft at a 15\u00c2\u00b0 phase angle. However, this image was taken at a 135\u00c2\u00b0 phase angle as Voyager left the planet. That geometry is ideal for detecting microscopic particles that forward scatter light preferentially. The fact that Neptune's rings are so much brighter at that angle means the particle-size distribution is quite different from most of Uranus' and Saturn's rings, which contain fewer dust-size grains. However, a few componenets of the Saturian and Uranian ring systems exhibit forward-scattering behavior: The F ring and the Encke Gap ringlet at Saturn and 1986U1R at Uranus. They are also narrow, clumpy ringlets with kinks, and are associated with nearby moonlets too small to detect directly. In this image, the main clumpy arc, composed of three features each about 6 to 8 degrees long, is clearly seen. Exposure time for this image was 111 seconds.",

( 8.0 million miles ) P-29467B/W Time lapse Voyager 2 images of Uranus show the movement of two small, bright, streaky clouds, the first such features ever seen on the planet. The clouds were detected in this series of orange filtered images, over a 4.6 hour interval ( from top to bottom ). Uranus, which is tipped on its side with respect to the other planets, is rotating in a counter-clockwise direction, with its pole of rotation near the center of the disk, as are the two clouds seen here as bright streaks. The larger of the two clouds is ata lattitude of 33 degrees. The smaller cloud, seen faintly in the three lower images, lies at 26 degrees ( a lower alttitude and hence closer to the limb). Their counterclockwise periods of rotation are 16.2 and 16.9 hours, respectively. This difference implies that the lower lattitude feature is lagging behind the higher latitude feture at a speed of almost 100 meters pers second (220 mph). Latitudinal bands are also visible in these images, the faint bands, more numerous now then in previous Voyager images from longer range, are concentric with the pole rotation. thatis, they circle the planet in lines of contant latitude.",

Voyager 1 completed its Jupiter encounter in early April, after taking almost 19,000 pictures and recording many other scientific measurements. Although astronomers had studied Jupiter from Earth for several centuries, scientists were surprised by many of Voyager 1 and 2's findings. They now understand that important physical, geological, and atmospheric processes go on that they had never observed from Earth. Discovery of active volcanism on the satellite Io was probably the greatest surprise. It was the first time active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the solar system. Voyager also discovered a ring around Jupiter. Thus Jupiter joins Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune as a ringed planet -- although each ring system is unique and distinct from the others.",

Visible here are a broad, bright outer component about 40 km (25 mi) wide; a darker, middle region of comparable width; and a narrow, bright inner strip about 15 km (9 mi) wide. The epsilon-ring structure seen by Voyager is similiar to that observed from the ground with stellar-occultation techniques.

The neutral gray color of Titania is characteristic of the Uranian satellites as a whole.",

In the course of taking this mosaic consisting of a total of 60 frames, Voyager 1 made several images of the inner solar system from a distance of approximately 4 billion miles and about 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane. Thirty-nine wide angle frames link together six of the planets of our solar system in this mosaic. Outermost Neptune is 30 times further from the sun than Earth. Our sun is seen as the bright object in the center of the circle of frames. The wide-angle image of the sun was taken with the camera's darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 thousandths of a second) to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. The sun is not large as seen from Voyager, only about one-fortieth of the diameter as seen from Earth, but is still almost 8 million times brighter than the brightest star in Earth's sky, Sirius. The result of this great brightness is an image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera. Wide-angle images surrounding the sun also show many artifacts attributable to scattered light in the optics. These were taken through the clear filter with one second exposures. The insets show the planets magnified many times. Narrow-angle images of Earth, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune were acquired as the spacecraft built the wide-angle mosaic. Jupiter is larger than a narrow-angle pixel and is clearly resolved, as is Saturn with its rings. Uranus and Neptune appear larger than they really are because of image smear due to spacecraft motion during the long (15 second) exposures. From Voyager's great distance Earth and Venus are mere points of light, less than the size of a picture element even in the narrow-angle camera. Earth was a crescent only 0.12 pixel in size. Coincidentally, Earth lies right in the center of one of the scattered light rays resulting from taking the image so close to the sun.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00451",

This is a computerized summation of six images shot by the narrow angle camera. It is the first photo to show the epsilon ring unblurred by Earth's atmosphere. The Epsilon ring, some 51,200 km. ( 31,800 miles )  from the planets center, is the most prominent of Uranus' nine known rings. Ground based observations of stellar occulations by the rings have determined that the Epsilon ring is eccentric, or elliptical, with its widest portion  about 100 km. ( 60 miles ) wide and its narrowest portion about 20 km. (12 miles ). Estimates of the rings brightness suggest that it is also very dark, with a reflectance of only 1 or 2  percent and a probable  composition of carbonaceous material similiar to that on dark asteroids and the dark side of Saturn's moon Lapetus. Because the ring is so narrow and dark, at this range,  the Voyager camera could not  resolve even the widest part,  resulting in long exposure times so obtain a good image. six exposures of 11 or 15 second duration were added together by computer to produce this image.  In this image, the central  portion is greatly overexposed. Various artifacts due to electronic effects  and image proccessing can be seen in the central portion of the frame, including the dark image just above the planets image, the diffuse brightening below it and the small, bright projection from the edge of the planet in the upper left. The ring is distinctly less prominent in the lower left portion and more prominent in the upper right. This is in agreement with the predicted locations of the narrow and wide portions of the ring, respectively.",

The two moons, designated 1986U7 and 1986U8, are seen here on either side of the bright Epsilon Ring. All nine of the known Uranian rings are visible here. The image was proccessed to enhance narrow features. The Epsilon Ring appears surrounded by a dark halo as a result of this proccessing. Occasional blips seen on the ring are also artifacts. Lying inward from the Epsilon Ring are the Delta, Gamma, and Eta Rings; then the Beta abd Alpha Rings; and finally, the barely visible 4, 5, and 6 Rings. The rings have been studied since their discovery in 1977, through observations of how they diminish the light of stars they pass in front of. This image is the first direct observationn of all nine rings in reflected sunlight. They range in width from about 100 km. (60 mi.) at the widest part of the Epsilon Ring to only a few kilometers  for most of the others. The discovery of the two ring moons 1986U7 and 1986U8 is a major advance in our understanding of the structure of the Uranian rings and is in good agreement with theoretical predictions of how these narrow rings are kept from spreading out. Based on likely surface brightness properties, the moons are of roughly 20 and 30 km. diameter, respectively.",

Ariel is about 1,200 km (750 mi) in diameter; the resolution here is 2.4 km (1.5 mi). Much of Ariel's surface is densely pitted with craters 5 to 10 km (3 to 6 mi) across. These craters are close to the threshold of detection in this picture. Numerous valleys and fault scarps crisscross the highly pitted terrain. voyager scientists believe the valleys have formed over down-dropped fault blocks (graben); apparently, extensive faulting has occured as a result of expansion and stretching of Ariel's crust. The largest fault valleys, near the terminator at right, as well as a smooth region near the center of this image, have been partly filled with deposits that are younger and less heavily cratered than the pitted terrain. Narrow, somewhat sinuous scarps and valleys have been formed, in turn, in these young deposits. It is not yet clear whether these sinuous features have been formed by faulting or by the flow of fluids.",

Titania is the largest satellite of Uranus, with a diameter of little more than 1,600 km (1,000 mi). Abundant impact craters of many sizes pockmark the ancient surface. The most prominant features are fault valleys that stretch across Titania. They are up to 1,500 km (nearly 1,000 mi) long and as much as 75 km (45 mi) wide. In valleys seen at right center, the sunward-facing walls are very bright. While this is due partly to the lighting angle, the brightness also indicates the presence of a lighter material, possibly young frost deposits. An impact crater more than 200 km (125 mi) in diameter distinguishes the very bottom of the disk; the crater is cut by a younger fault valley more than 100 km (60 mi) wide. An even larger impact crater, perhaps 300 km (180 mi) across, is visible at top.",

P-29498C This false color, Voyager 2 composite view of all nine of Uranian rings  was made from six 15 second exposures through the narrow angle camera. The special computer processing  used to extract color information from the extremely dark and faint rings, causing the even fainter, pastel lines seen between the rings. Two images, each in the green, clear, & violet filters, were added together and averaged to find the proper color difference between the rings. the final image was made from these three color averages and represents an enhanced, false color view. The image shows that the brightest, or Epsilon ring, at top ,is neutral in color, with the fainter eight other rings showing color differences between them. moving down, toward, Uranus, we see the Delta, Gamma, & Eta rings in shades of blue and green; the Beta & Alpha rings in somewhat lighter tones; and then finally, a set of three, known simply as 4, 5, & 6 rings, in faint off-white tones. Scientists will use this color information to try to understand the nature and origin of the ring material.",

Miranda's regional geologic provinces show very well in this view of the southern hemisphere. The dark and bright banded region, with its curvilinear traces, covers about half of the image. Higher resolution pictures taken later show many fault lines valleys and ridges parallel to these bands. Near the terminator (at right), another system of ridges and valleys abuts the banded terrain, while many impact craters pockmark the surface in this region. The largest of these are about 30 km.

The moon was found December 30, 1985; it was the first and largest of nine satellites discovered by the spacecraft's cameras. This image shows 1986U1 to be a dark, nearly spherical object, with a diameter of about 150 km (90 mi); the dark surface reflects only 7 percent of the incident light. The picture was inserted into the Voyager encounter sequence late in its development.This image has had a complex history, having been recorded on the spacecraft tape recorder and first played back during the late afternoon of its recording. An antenna-pointing problem at one of the Austrailian tracking stations led to the loss of the data, so the image had to be retransmitted."

This frame, taken through the clear-filter of Voyager's narrow-angle camera, is the most detailed image of Umbriel, with a resolution of about 10 km (6 mi). Umbriel is the darkest of Uranus' larger moons and the one that appears to have experienced the lowest level of geological activity. It has a diameter of about 1,200 km (750 mi) and reflects only 16 percent of the light striking its surface; in the latter respect, Umbriel is similiar to lunar highland areas. Umbriel is heavily cratered but lacks the numerous bright-ray craters seen on the other large Uranian satellites; this results in a relatively uniform surface albedo (reflectivity). The prominent crater on the terminator (upper right) is about 110 km (70 mi) across and has a bright central peak. The strangest feature in this image (at top) is a curious bright ring, the most reflective area seen on Umbriel. The ring is about 140 km (90 mi) in diameter and lies near the satellite's equator. The nature of the ring is not known, although it might be a frost deposit, perhaps associated with an impact crater. Spots against the black background are due to 'noise' in the data."

The cloud visible here is the most prominent feature seen in a series of Voyager images designed to track atmospheric motions.  The occasional donut shaped features, including one at the bottom, are shadows cast by dust on the camera  optics. The picture is a highly processed composite of three images. The processing necessary to bring out the faint features on the planet also brings out these camera blemishes. The three seperate images used where shot through violet, blue, and orange filters. Each color image showd the cloud to a different degree; because they were not exposed at the same time , the images were processed to provide a good spatial match. In a true color image, the cloud would be barely discernable; the false color helps to bring out additional details. The different colors imply variations in vertical structure, but as of yet it is not possible to be specific about such differences. One possiblity is that the uranian atmosphere may contain smog like constituents, in which case some color differences may represent  differences in how these molecules are distributed."

Lewis improved the spacecraft and tested it extensively throughout the early 1960s. In May 1966 an Atlas-Centaur sent the Surveyor spacecraft to the moon. It was the first successful soft landing on another planet.     The Launch Vehicles Division was formed in 1969 to handle the increasing number of Centaur launches. The Lewis team became experts at integrating the payload with the Centaur and calculating proper trajectories for the missions.

The names, listed below, pay homage to the underworld mythology, pioneering space missions, historic pioneers who crossed new horizons in exploration, and scientists and engineers associated with Pluto and the Kuiper Belt.       Tombaugh Regio honors Clyde Tombaugh (1906-1997), the U.S. astronomer who discovered Pluto in 1930 from Lowell Observatory in Arizona.      Burney crater honors Venetia Burney (1918-2009), who as an 11-year-old schoolgirl suggested the name \"Pluto\" for Clyde Tombaugh's newly discovered planet. Later in life she taught mathematics and economics.      Sputnik Planitia is a large plain named for Sputnik 1, the first space satellite, launched by the Soviet Union in 1957.      Tenzing Montes and Hillary Montes are mountain ranges honoring Tenzing Norgay (1914-1986) and Sir Edmund Hillary (1919-2008), the Indian/Nepali Sherpa and New Zealand mountaineer were the first to reach the summit of Mount Everest and return safely.      Al-Idrisi Montes honors Ash-Sharif al-Idrisi (1100-1165/66), a noted Arab mapmaker and geographer whose landmark work of medieval geography is sometimes translated as \"The Pleasure of Him Who Longs to Cross the Horizons.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d      Djanggawul Fossae defines a network of long, narrow depressions named for the Djanggawuls, three ancestral beings in indigenous Australian mythology who traveled between the island of the dead and Australia, creating the landscape and filling it with vegetation.      Sleipnir Fossa is named for the powerful, eight-legged horse of Norse mythology that carried the god Odin into the underworld.      Virgil Fossae honors Virgil, one of the greatest Roman poets and Dante's fictional guide through hell and purgatory in the Divine Comedy.      Adlivun Cavus is a deep depression named for Adlivun, the underworld in Inuit mythology.      Hayabusa Terra is a large land mass saluting the Japanese spacecraft and mission (2003-2010) that performed the first asteroid sample return.      Voyager Terra honors the pair of NASA spacecraft, launched in 1977, that performed the first \"grand tour\" of all four giant planets. The Voyager spacecraft are now probing the boundary between the Sun and interstellar space.      Tartarus Dorsa is a ridge named for Tartarus, the deepest, darkest pit of the underworld in Greek mythology.      Elliot crater recognizes James Elliot (1943-2011), an MIT researcher who pioneered the use of stellar occultations to study the solar system -- leading to discoveries such as the rings of Uranus and the first detection of Pluto's thin atmosphere.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21944"

The two maps represent nearly back-to-back rotations of the planet, making it possible to determine the speeds of Jupiter\u2019s winds. Already, the images have revealed a rare wave just north of the planet\u2019s equator and a unique filament-like feature in the core of the Great Red Spot that had not been seen previously.  In addition, the new images confirm that the Great Red Spot continues to shrink and become more circular, as it has been doing for years. The long axis of this characteristic storm is about 150 miles (240 kilometers) shorter now than it was in 2014. Recently, the storm had been shrinking at a faster-than-usual rate, but the latest change is consistent with the long-term trend.

The star is ending its life by casting off its outer layers of gas, which formed a cocoon around the star's remaining core. Ultraviolet light from the dying star makes the material glow. The burned-out star, called a white dwarf, is the white dot in the center. Our sun will eventually burn out and shroud itself with stellar debris, but not for another 5 billion years.  Our Milky Way Galaxy is littered with these stellar relics, called planetary nebulae. The objects have nothing to do with planets. Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century astronomers called them the name because through small telescopes they resembled the disks of the distant planets Uranus and Neptune. The planetary nebula in this image is called NGC 2440. The white dwarf at the center of NGC 2440 is one of the hottest known, with a surface temperature of more than 360,000 degrees Fahrenheit (200,000 degrees Celsius). The nebula's chaotic structure suggests that the star shed its mass episodically. During each outburst, the star expelled material in a different direction. This can be seen in the two bowtie-shaped lobes. The nebula also is rich in clouds of dust, some of which form long, dark streaks pointing away from the star. NGC 2440 lies about 4,000 light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Puppis.  The material expelled by the star glows with different colors depending on its composition, its density and how close it is to the hot central star. Blue samples helium; blue-green oxygen, and red nitrogen and hydrogen.   Credit: NASA, ESA, and K.
