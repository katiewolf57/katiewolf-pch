Spacecraft now allow us the luxury to study these cosmic crossings at times of our choosing from unique locales across our solar system.This poster is from a set of new \"travel posters\" from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, which envision a day when the creativity of scientists and engineers will allow us to do things we can only dream of now. The posters in the set depict various cosmic destinations including Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, Saturn's vapor-spewing moon Enceladus, and the dwarf planet Ceres. You can take a virtual trip to 14 alien worlds, and maybe even plaster your living room with planetary art, via the new, futuristic space tourism posters. The posters are the brainchild of The Studio at JPL, a design and strategy team that works with JPL scientists and engineers to visualize and depict complex science and technology topics. Their work is used in designing space missions and in sharing the work of NASA/JPL with the public. The Archive copy is a high resolution TIFF image that can be downloaded from the digital library and printed 20 x 30 inches in high-resolution.",

                    "Mariner 10 was the seventh successful launch in the Mariner series and the first spacecraft to use the gravitational pull of one planet (Venus) to reach another (Mercury). It was also the first probe to visit two planets. Launched on November 3, 1973, it reached Venus on February 5, 1974. Using a gravity assist from this planet, Mariner 10 first crossed the orbit of Mercury on March 29, 1974 and did so a second time on September 21, 1974. A third and last Mercury encounter took place on March 16, 1975. It measured the environments of both Venus and Mercury. It then undertook experiments in the interplanetary medium. Mariner 10 showed that Venus had at best a weak magnetic field, and the ionosphere interacted with the solar wind to form a bow shock. At Mercury, it confirmed that Mercury had no atmosphere and a cratered, dormant Moon-like surface.",

                    "Mariner 10 was the seventh successful launch in the Mariner series and the first spacecraft to use the gravitational pull of one planet (Venus) to reach another (Mercury). It was also the first probe to visit two planets. Launched on November 3, 1973, it reached Venus on February 5, 1974. Using a gravity assist from this planet, Mariner 10 first crossed the orbit of Mercury on March 29, 1974 and did so a second time on September 21, 1974. A third and last Mercury encounter took place on March 16, 1975. It measured the environments of both Venus and Mercury. It then undertook experiments in the interplanetary medium. Mariner 10 showed that Venus had at best a weak magnetic field, and its ionosphere interacted with the solar wind to form a bow shock. At Mercury, it confirmed that Mercury had no atmosphere and a cratered, dormant Moon-like surface.",

                    "Mariner 10 and Earth-based observations have revealed Mercury, the innermost of the terrestrial planetary bodies, to be an exciting laboratory for the study of Solar System geological processes. Mercury is characterized by a lunar-like surface, a global magnetic field, and an interior and by an iron core having a radius at least three-quarters of the radius of the planet. The 45% of the surface imaged by Mariner 10 reveals some distinctive differences from the Moon, however, with major contractional fault scarps and huge expanses of moderate-albedo Cayley-like smooth plains of uncertain origin. Our current image coverage of Mercury is comparable to that of telescopic photographs of the Earth's Moon prior to the launch of Sputnik in 1957. We have no photographic images of one-half of the surface, the resolution of the images we do have is generally poor (similar to 1 km), and as with many lunar telescopic photographs, much of the available surface of Mercury is distorted by foreshortening due to viewing geometry, or poorly suited for geological analysis and impact-crater counting for age determinations because of high-Sun illumination conditions. Currently available topographic information is also very limited. Nonetheless, Mercury is a geological laboratory that represents (1) a planet where the presence of a huge iron core may be due to impact stripping of the crust and upper mantle, or alternatively, where formation of a huge core may have resulted in a residual mantle and crust of potentially unusual composition and structure; (2) a planet with an internal chemical and mechanical structure that provides new insights into planetary thermal history and the relative roles of conduction and convection in planetary heat loss; (3) a one-tectonic-plate planet where constraints on major interior processes can be deduced from the geology of the global tectonic system; (4) a planet where volcanic resurfacing may not have played a significant role in planetary history and internally generated volcanic resurfacing may have ceased at similar to 3.8 Ga; (5) a planet where impact craters can be used to disentangle the fundamental roles of gravity and mean impactor velocity in determining impact crater morphology and morphometry; (6) an environment where global impact crater counts can test fundamental concepts of the distribution of impactor populations in space and time; (7) an extreme environment in which highly radar-reflective polar deposits, much more extensive than those on the Moon, can be better understood; (8) an extreme environment in which the basic processes of space weathering can be further deduced; and (9) a potential end-member in terrestrial planetary body geological evolution in which the relationships of internal and surface evolution can be clearly assessed from both a tectonic and volcanic point of view. In the half-century since the launch of Sputnik, more than 30 spacecraft have been sent to the Moon, yet only now is a second spacecraft en route to Mercury. The MESSENGER mission will address key questions about the geologic evolution of Mercury; the depth and breadth of the MESSENGER data will permit the confident reconstruction of the geological history and thermal evolution of Mercury using new imaging, topography, chemistry, mineralogy, gravity, magnetic, and environmental data",

Nonetheless, Mercury is a geological laboratory that represents (1) a planet where the presence of a huge iron core may be due to impact stripping of the crust and upper mantle, or alternatively, where formation of a huge core may have resulted in a residual mantle and crust of potentially unusual composition and structure; (2) a planet with an internal chemical and mechanical structure that provides new insights into planetary thermal history and the relative roles of conduction and convection in planetary heat loss; (3) a one-tectonic-plate planet where constraints on major interior processes can be deduced from the geology of the global tectonic system; (4) a planet where volcanic resurfacing may not have played a significant role in planetary history and internally generated volcanic resurfacing may have ceased at similar to 3.8 Ga; (5) a planet where impact craters can be used to disentangle the fundamental roles of gravity and mean impactor velocity in determining impact crater morphology and morphometry; (6) an environment where global impact crater counts can test fundamental concepts of the distribution of impactor populations in space and time; (7) an extreme environment in which highly radar-reflective polar deposits, much more extensive than those on the Moon, can be better understood; (8) an extreme environment in which the basic processes of space weathering can be further deduced; and (9) a potential end-member in terrestrial planetary body geological evolution in which the relationships of internal and surface evolution can be clearly assessed from both a tectonic and volcanic point of view. In the half-century since the launch of Sputnik, more than 30 spacecraft have been sent to the Moon, yet only now is a second spacecraft en route to Mercury. The MESSENGER mission will address key questions about the geologic evolution of Mercury; the depth and breadth of the MESSENGER data will permit the confident reconstruction of the geological history and thermal evolution of Mercury using new imaging, topography, chemistry, mineralogy, gravity, magnetic, and environmental data",

                    "The surface of Mercury has been heavily modified by impact cratering and volcanic plains since the initial formation of its lithosphere and crust. As in the case of the Moon, the origin of early plains deposits has been difficult to determine because ponded impact basin ejecta and impact melt deposits can mimic the topography and texture of extrusive volcanic plains. In order to understand better the role that impact basins play in resurfacing on Mercury, we used MESSENGER Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) data to map the distribution of plains deposits within and around the relatively young Rembrandt impact basin (~720 km in diameter). There are two different Rembrandt plains units: (1) high-reflectance interior and exterior plains, and (2) low-reflectance exterior plains. The morphology, crater size-frequency distribution, and N(20) crater density were analyzed for each deposit. Observations of the two high-reflectance plains deposits are consistent with previous studies of volcanically produced smooth plains on Mercury. The low-reflectance exterior plains are older than the other high-reflectance plains and comparable in age to the Rembrandt basin impact event. On the basis of age, areal distribution, and albedo relationships with basin materials, the low-reflectance plains are interpreted as basin impact melt deposits. The large areal extent of the low-reflectance plains suggests that basin impact melt deposits may have played an important role in resurfacing Mercury, especially during the early geologic history of the planet when impact rates were higher.",

                            "#text": "The surface of Mercury has been heavily modified by impact cratering and volcanic plains since the initial formation of its lithosphere and crust. As in the case of the Moon, the origin of early plains deposits has been difficult to determine because ponded impact basin ejecta and impact melt deposits can mimic the topography and texture of extrusive volcanic plains. In order to understand better the role that impact basins play in resurfacing on Mercury, we used MESSENGER Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) data to map the distribution of plains deposits within and around the relatively young Rembrandt impact basin (~720 km in diameter). There are two different Rembrandt plains units: (1) high-reflectance interior and exterior plains, and (2) low-reflectance exterior plains. The morphology, crater size-frequency distribution, and N(20) crater density were analyzed for each deposit. Observations of the two high-reflectance plains deposits are consistent with previous studies of volcanically produced smooth plains on Mercury. The low-reflectance exterior plains are older than the other high-reflectance plains and comparable in age to the Rembrandt basin impact event. On the basis of age, areal distribution, and albedo relationships with basin materials, the low-reflectance plains are interpreted as basin impact melt deposits. The large areal extent of the low-reflectance plains suggests that basin impact melt deposits may have played an important role in resurfacing Mercury, especially during the early geologic history of the planet when impact rates were higher.",

                    "During its first two flybys of Mercury, the {MESSENGER} spacecraft acquired images confirming that pervasive volcanism occurred early in the planet's history. {MESSENGER's} third Mercury flyby revealed a 290-km-diameter peak-ring impact basin, among the youngest basins yet seen, having an inner floor filled with spectrally distinct smooth plains. These plains are sparsely cratered, postdate the formation of the basin, apparently formed from material that once flowed across the surface, and are therefore interpreted to be volcanic in origin. An irregular depression surrounded by a halo of bright deposits northeast of the basin marks a candidate explosive volcanic vent larger than any previously identified on Mercury. Volcanism on the planet thus spanned a considerable duration, perhaps extending well into the second half of solar system history.",

                    "The astrobiological problem of the occurrence of life in the universe is discussed from the standpoint of the size and nature of planets upon which living organisms might arise. The conclusion is tentatively drawn that the most likely radius of a habitable planet lies between 10(exp 8) cm and 2 x 10(exp 9) cm. Conditions of temperature and density also bear upon the occurrence of life; thus the moon and Mercury, although both fall within the range of favorable radii, are nevertheless believed uninhabited by indigeneous life."

                    "The Mercury Laser Altimeter on the {NASA} {MESSENGER} mission has ranged to several ridges and lobate scarps during two equatorial flybys of the planet Mercury. The tectonic features sampled, like others documented by spacecraft imaging and Earth-based radar, are spatially isolated and have vertical relief in excess of 1 km. The profiles also indicate that the faulting associated with their formation penetrated to tens of kilometers depth into the lithosphere and accommodated substantial shortening. To gain insight into the mechanism(s) of strain accommodation across these structures, we perform analytical and numerical modeling of representative dynamic localization mechanisms. We find that ductile localization due to shear heating is not favored, given our current understanding of thermal gradients and shallow thermal structure of Mercury at the time of ridge and scarp formation, and is likely to be of secondary importance at best. Brittle localization, associated with loss of resistance during fault development or with velocity weakening during sliding on mature faults, is weakly localizing but permits slip to accumulate over geological time scales. The range of shallow thermal gradients that produce isolated faults rather than distributed fault sets under the assumption of modest fault weakening is consistent with previous models for Mercury's early global thermal history. To be consistent with strain rates predicted from thermal history models and the amount of shortening required to account for the underlying large-offset faults, ridges and scarps on Mercury likely developed over geologically substantial time spans.",

The tectonic features sampled, like others documented by spacecraft imaging and Earth-based radar, are spatially isolated and have vertical relief in excess of 1 km. The profiles also indicate that the faulting associated with their formation penetrated to tens of kilometers depth into the lithosphere and accommodated substantial shortening. To gain insight into the mechanism(s) of strain accommodation across these structures, we perform analytical and numerical modeling of representative dynamic localization mechanisms. We find that ductile localization due to shear heating is not favored, given our current understanding of thermal gradients and shallow thermal structure of Mercury at the time of ridge and scarp formation, and is likely to be of secondary importance at best. Brittle localization, associated with loss of resistance during fault development or with velocity weakening during sliding on mature faults, is weakly localizing but permits slip to accumulate over geological time scales. The range of shallow thermal gradients that produce isolated faults rather than distributed fault sets under the assumption of modest fault weakening is consistent with previous models for Mercury's early global thermal history. To be consistent with strain rates predicted from thermal history models and the amount of shortening required to account for the underlying large-offset faults, ridges and scarps on Mercury likely developed over geologically substantial time spans.",

The ancient Greeks used the word \u0093planet\u0094, which means wanderer, to describe the huge objects they saw in the sky because they appear to move while the stars in the background appear to stand still. While now we know that everything is moving, including the stars, the name \u0093planet\u0094 stuck with us. According to how scientists define the term, there are eight planets in oursolar system, meaning, objects that orbitthe Sun. The sun uses gravity to keep the planets spinning in orbit, and it also provides heat and light to each of them. The four inner planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Composed of mostly rock and metal and with solid surfaces, these are given the term \u0093terrestiral\u0094 or Earth-like. The four outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are all much larger than the inner planets; Jupiter is larger than the seven other planets combined! In addition to their size, they also differ from the inner planets in that they have no solid surfaces; they are made of liquid and gases, and they each have a ring system and several moons.

                    "Mapping the distribution and extent of major terrain types on a planet's surface helps to constrain the origin and evolution of its crust. Together, MESSENGER and Mariner 10 observations of Mercury now provide a near-global look at the planet, revealing lateral and vertical heterogeneities in the color and thus composition of Mercury's crust. Smooth plains cover approximately 40% of the surface, and evidence for the volcanic origin of large expanses of plains suggests that a substantial portion of the crust originated volcanically. A low-reflectance, relatively blue component affects at least 15% of the surface and is concentrated in crater and basin ejecta. Its spectral characteristics and likely origin at depth are consistent with its apparent excavation from a lower crust or upper mantle enriched in iron- and titanium-bearing oxides.",

Together, MESSENGER and Mariner 10 observations of Mercury now provide a near-global look at the planet, revealing lateral and vertical heterogeneities in the color and thus composition of Mercury's crust. Smooth plains cover approximately 40% of the surface, and evidence for the volcanic origin of large expanses of plains suggests that a substantial portion of the crust originated volcanically. A low-reflectance, relatively blue component affects at least 15% of the surface and is concentrated in crater and basin ejecta. Its spectral characteristics and likely origin at depth are consistent with its apparent excavation from a lower crust or upper mantle enriched in iron- and titanium-bearing oxides.",

                    "MESSENGER orbital images show that the north polar region of Mercury contains ~7% of the recognized area of smooth plains on the planet. Within the northern smooth plains (NSP) we identify two crater populations, those superposed on the NSP (\u201cpost-plains\u201d) and those partially or entirely embayed (\u201cburied\u201d). The existence of the second of these populations is clear evidence for volcanic resurfacing. The post-plains crater population reveals that the NSP do not exhibit statistically distinguishable subunits on the basis of crater size\u2013frequency distributions, nor do measures of the areal density of impact craters reveal volcanically resurfaced regions within the NSP. These results suggest that the most recent outpouring of volcanic material resurfaced the majority of the region, and that this volcanic flooding emplaced the NSP over a relatively short interval of geologic time, perhaps 100 My or less. Stratigraphic embayment relationships within the buried crater population, including partial crater flooding and the presence of smaller embayed craters within the filled interiors of larger craters and basins, indicate that a minimum of two episodes of volcanic resurfacing occurred. From the inferred rim heights of embayed craters, we estimate the NSP to be regionally 0.7\u20131.8 km thick, with a minimum volume of volcanic material of 4 \u00d7 106 to 107 km3. Because of the uncertainty in the impact flux at Mercury, the absolute model age of the post-plains volcanism could be either ~3.7 or ~2.5 Ga, depending on the chronology applied.",

                    "This maser element was part of experiments conducted in the 1960s at MIT's Haystack radio and radar facility to confirm Einstein's prediction of the slowing of radiation by a strong gravitational field. The development of masers in the early 1960's greatly enhanced the sensitivity of radar receivers, making it possible to measure signals reflected from distant planets. In 1964 Irwin Shapiro, then at MIT's Lincoln laboratory, made careful measurements of the transit time of 7.84 GHz radar signals reflected from Mercury when that planet was about to disappear behind the solar limb. He found that the sun's gravitational field had added about 200 microseconds to the signal's round trip travel time. This confirmation of the prediction, now known as the \"Shapiro time delay\" was at the time the most accurate evidence for Einstein's theory.

                "description": "While there is much debate over which exoplanet discovery is considered the \"first,\" one stands out from the rest. In 1995, scientists discovered 51 Pegasi b, forever changing the way we see the universe and our place in it. The exoplanet is about half the mass of Jupiter, with a seemingly impossible, star-hugging orbit of only 4.2 Earth days. Not only was it the first planet confirmed to orbit a sun-like star; it also ushered in a whole new class of planets called Hot Jupiters: hot, massive planets orbiting closer to their stars than Mercury. Today, powerful observatories like NASA's Kepler space telescope, will continue the hunt of distant planets. This poster is from a set of new \"travel posters\" from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, which envision a day when the creativity of scientists and engineers will allow us to do things we can only dream of now. The posters in the set depict various cosmic destinations including Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, Saturn's vapor-spewing moon Enceladus, and the dwarf planet Ceres. You can take a virtual trip to 14 alien worlds, and maybe even plaster your living room with planetary art, via the new, futuristic space tourism posters. The posters are the brainchild of The Studio at JPL, a design and strategy team that works with JPL scientists and engineers to visualize and depict complex science and technology topics. Their work is used in designing space missions and in sharing the work of NASA/JPL with the public. The Archive copy is a high resolution TIFF image that can be downloaded from the digital library and printed 20 x 30 inches in high-resolution.",

                            "description": "While there is much debate over which exoplanet discovery is considered the \"first,\" one stands out from the rest. In 1995, scientists discovered 51 Pegasi b, forever changing the way we see the universe and our place in it. The exoplanet is about half the mass of Jupiter, with a seemingly impossible, star-hugging orbit of only 4.2 Earth days. Not only was it the first planet confirmed to orbit a sun-like star; it also ushered in a whole new class of planets called Hot Jupiters: hot, massive planets orbiting closer to their stars than Mercury. Today, powerful observatories like NASA's Kepler space telescope, will continue the hunt of distant planets. This poster is from a set of new \"travel posters\" from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, which envision a day when the creativity of scientists and engineers will allow us to do things we can only dream of now. The posters in the set depict various cosmic destinations including Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, Saturn's vapor-spewing moon Enceladus, and the dwarf planet Ceres. You can take a virtual trip to 14 alien worlds, and maybe even plaster your living room with planetary art, via the new, futuristic space tourism posters. The posters are the brainchild of The Studio at JPL, a design and strategy team that works with JPL scientists and engineers to visualize and depict complex science and technology topics. Their work is used in designing space missions and in sharing the work of NASA/JPL with the public. The Archive copy is a high resolution TIFF image that can be downloaded from the digital library and printed 20 x 30 inches in high-resolution.",

                    "The MESSENGER Gamma-Ray Spectrometer measured the average surface abundances of the radioactive elements potassium (K, 1150 \u00b1 220 parts per million), thorium (Th, 220 \u00b1 60 parts per billion), and uranium (U, 90 \u00b1 20 parts per billion) in Mercury\u2019s northern hemisphere. The abundance of the moderately volatile element K, relative to Th and U, is inconsistent with physical models for the formation of Mercury requiring extreme heating of the planet or its precursor materials, and supports formation from volatile-containing material comparable to chondritic meteorites. Abundances of K, Th, and U indicate that internal heat production has declined substantially since Mercury\u2019s formation, consistent with widespread volcanism shortly after the end of late heavy bombardment 3.8 billion years ago and limited, isolated volcanic activity since.",

The abundance of the moderately volatile element K, relative to Th and U, is inconsistent with physical models for the formation of Mercury requiring extreme heating of the planet or its precursor materials, and supports formation from volatile-containing material comparable to chondritic meteorites. Abundances of K, Th, and U indicate that internal heat production has declined substantially since Mercury\u2019s formation, consistent with widespread volcanism shortly after the end of late heavy bombardment 3.8 billion years ago and limited, isolated volcanic activity since.",

                    "High-resolution images of Mercury's surface from orbit reveal that many bright deposits within impact craters exhibit fresh-appearing, irregular, shallow, rimless depressions. The depressions, or hollows, range from tens of meters to a few kilometers across, and many have high-reflectance interiors and halos. The host rocks, which are associated with crater central peaks, peak rings, floors, and walls, are interpreted to have been excavated from depth by the crater-forming process. The most likely formation mechanisms for the hollows involve recent loss of volatiles through some combination of sublimation, space weathering, outgassing, or pyroclastic volcanism. These features support the inference that Mercury's interior contains higher abundances of volatile materials than predicted by most scenarios for the formation of the solar system's innermost planet.",

The depressions, or hollows, range from tens of meters to a few kilometers across, and many have high-reflectance interiors and halos. The host rocks, which are associated with crater central peaks, peak rings, floors, and walls, are interpreted to have been excavated from depth by the crater-forming process. The most likely formation mechanisms for the hollows involve recent loss of volatiles through some combination of sublimation, space weathering, outgassing, or pyroclastic volcanism. These features support the inference that Mercury's interior contains higher abundances of volatile materials than predicted by most scenarios for the formation of the solar system's innermost planet.",

In use, the planets would be pushed by hand around the sun. Jones introduced this instrument in his Description & Use of a New Portable Orrery (London, 1782). In the second edition of this text (1784) he included a lengthy discussion of the Georgium Sidus, the planet now known as Uranus that was discovered by William Herschel in 1781.

The goal is to create an archive which adds relevant material to the existing historical record. Oral history recordings and transcripts are primary source material and do not represent the final, verified, or complete narrative of the events under discussion. Rather, oral history is a spoken remembrance or dialogue, reflecting the interviewee\u2019s memories, points of view and personal opinions about events in response to the interviewer\u2019s specific questions. Oral history interviews document each interviewee\u2019s personal engagement with the history in question. They are unique records, reflecting the particular meaning the interviewee draws from her/ his individual life experience.

Peggy Bostian: I moved here with my family. I was born in Washington state, in a beautiful, green trees Washington state. When I was fourteen years old, my family came to Las Vegas, this dry, flat, not green desert. And as we were driving\u2014 there were four kids in the family\u2014 I think it was through Salt Lake, we came down where you see Las Vegas, I thought, what have my parents done? This is a terrible place. It was in September so I immediately enrolled at Las Vegas High School, which at that time was the only public high school. Gorman, the Catholic high school, was just built, and so that was the only high school there was to go to. And once I got into meeting friends and so forth, Las Vegas became home. And so I graduated from high school in 1958. As a summer job, I worked at REECo, Reynolds Electrical and Engineering Company, as I think, a clerk- typist in purchasing, typing purchase orders. And I worked out at the test site on a temporary basis the following summer. During the school year, I\u2019d gone to Woodbury College in Los Angeles. Worked out at the [ Nevada] test site as a secretary to the head of personnel, and from there went to sort of working my way up. I went to work for the head of construction, which was a very interesting job. The most interesting was to work for Dr. Clinton S. Maupin, who\u2019s the father\u2014 just learned a few months ago\u2014 of one of our supreme court justices, Bill Maupin. Dr. Maupin was the head of health medicine and safety. RAD- SAFE, radiation safety department, was under Dr. Maupin. And he was always a member of the test panel, which every time there was a shot he\u2019d go out to UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 2 the control point, as was Troy [ Wade] a member. We have some pictures of Troy Wade looking up at the instruments and so forth. And I remember one day Dr. Maupin\u2014 we were young secretaries and we would sort of pester him and say, We would like to go to a shot. And this was in about 1961, 1962, 1963. He\u2019d sort of just brush us off and so forth. And then one day we all came to work and he said, Tomorrow we\u2019ll all go to see a shot. We have a little shot tomorrow. We said, Oh good. So we went out to the control point and that shot was Sedan, which was a phenomenal shot to see. Have you been out to the test site? Yes. The big crater? The enormous crater. He waited until we had a significant shot to see, and that was very, very thrilling. But he told you it was a little\u2014 Yes, OK, girls. And then you could call girls \u201c girls,\u201d you know. We were girls, practically, so it wasn\u2019t politically incorrect to say. We\u2019re going to go out to the--OK. And I\u2019ve been so glad that I was able to be there and see that shot. Now did it cave in after? What it did, it raised up and sunk. It\u2019s what they call an excavation shot. And this was all part of the Plowshare program, the idea that you could build canals, the small power of a nuclear explosive could make these huge subsidence craters. So that was a big thrill. Now where were you standing when you saw that? How far away were you? [ 00: 05: 00] Very, very, very close. We were in a visitor trailer, as I recall, and, oh, probably, let me see, here we are on Flamingo Road. Probably at Kinko\u2019s [ 2- 3 blocks]. So pretty close. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 3 Yes, or maybe McCormick and Schmick, the restaurant. Yes, quite close. And did the earth shake? Did you feel that? Oh yes. And it made a noise. Oh really. Yes. Somewhere there might even be\u2014 I\u2019m sure there\u2019s videos but there might be audio as well. And I think that shot did what it was supposed to do. And the power that is so evident is pretty overwhelming. Really. Yes. So when you left, you felt overwhelmed by seeing that? It was very profound sense of what the power of a nuclear explosive can do. And it\u2019s interesting because Troy Wade assembled the device for that shot, and the device is what they called it instead of a bomb. But he did the assembly of that particular shot. And was he in there with you when\u2014? No, because he would be one of the ones at the Control Point panel literally controlling the setting- off, controlling the countdown and so forth, so they were in a more important and closer area than we were. Did you feel safe when the bomb went off? Yes, because we had been so familiar with test site activity, simply being residents of Las Vegas, even though I was very young, Well, that\u2019s the test site. They test bombs out there. And then you would see things in the paper and maybe your class would have a speaker come and talk about how safe everything was. Oh really? You had somebody come in when you were in high school? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 4 I went to school from 1954 to 1958, so I recall that somebody, maybe from AEC [ Atomic Energy Commission] or something, would come; this little booklet here [ showing booklet] was handed out. I had lost mine but one of my guy friends from school remembered that he had one of those little booklets and brought it to me. And one of our local citizens, prominent citizens in Nevada, particularly Las Vegas, her name is here, Thalia Dondero. She has just donated a bunch of these for us to sell in the [ Atomic Testing Museum] bookstore. [ Atomic Tests in Nevada, 1957, United States Atomic Energy Commission]. So you were exposed to this in high school. Yes, even though it wasn\u2019t like we studied it in great depth because it also was very, very, very classified. But we got used to it. And somebody\u2019s parents would work out at the test site, so it just became something we were familiar with. We didn\u2019t understand it all particularly; we were interested more in high school things than what was going on out there. Did you have drills at all? No. But a lot of my friends who were born here, who are a little older than I am, remember the duck- and- cover things and hiding under the desks. And I remember going out right after we moved here, going out six o\u2019clock in the morning or something and staring up north and you\u2019d see a flash of light and so forth. Now how did that impress you at that time? Without wholly understanding and being new to Nevada\u2014 it certainly wasn\u2019t as profound, even though it might\u2014 as seeing Sedan when I was a little older. But it was\u2014 and we didn\u2019t understand the real scientific significance or political. I was fourteen or fifteen years old. But it was something that I look back now and I\u2019m so glad that my parents [ 00: 10: 00] made us get up and watch. Some of my friends\u2019 parents would pile them in the car and drive up to somewhere UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 5 up closer to the test site. I think one of my friends said they would go up and park at Angel\u2019s Peak or something so they could really see. But you saw the flash of light and\u2014 Yes, I remember that, and I think after the first couple of times that we saw one of the shots we said, OK, well, we\u2019ve seen those. We don\u2019t need to see them anymore. I have to go to school now. So it was blas\u00e9? Yes. And here\u2019s someone like you, didn\u2019t know about the test site. And that was just\u2014 I don\u2019t remember the figures but I remember, if it\u2019s correct, that EG if they were sick. I believe we were able to use sick leave, our own sick leave, if I needed to stay home because one of my girls was ill or something. So I didn\u2019t get any sense\u2014 but 1951, that was like day one, as you said, so they were probably just forming policies and so forth. And I think too that a lot of things changed from the 1950s to the early 1960s. I think it was a real dramatic shift. Yes. Absolutely. But that\u2019s interesting that there was no\u2014 you didn\u2019t feel any kind of push or anything. No. Not at all. Well, that\u2019s really interesting. So now you start working at the Las Vegas office because you\u2019re not having to do that long commute. Right. And then from there where did you go to\u2014? Then I was approached by Hal Aronson, he\u2019s a member of our foundation, about going to work at CER Corporation, and Herb Grier was the president. He was the EG we called them secretaries and executive secretaries. And if you worked really hard, you could make your way up to be an administrative assistant. Oh really? That\u2019s interesting. So what were your duties when you started working for this other\u2014? Again, it was\u2014 oh, another piece of this CER Geonuclear Corporation was bringing in an industrial client like an oil company. The first one we worked with was called Austral Oil Company from Houston, Texas. They were the client. They had the property that they wanted developed. And so my job was as support to the two vice presidents who were working in bringing business in, coordinating with the AEC to get this project in Colorado off the ground. We would be working with officials in Colorado at the state, county and city level near where this project was going to be accomplished. And I don\u2019t know what to compare it to in the office today except if you\u2019ve been an executive secretary, it\u2019s sort of the same. The only difference is this was so unique and challenging and exciting. It was a job I enjoyed really very, very much. Was it due to the fact that there were new things coming up all the time? Well, it was more\u2014 that this was such a profound\u2014 it had such profound possibilities. Nobody had ever\u2014 I mean the Plowshare program had been in place for a while. There was a Project Gasbuggy, I think that was in New Mexico, and the experiments were for peaceful uses of nuclear explosives. And at that time, we hadn\u2019t been discouraged by the political aspects or the environmental aspects, reactions we were getting from the citizens of Colorado. It was all new and had great prospects. In fact, that feeling about working, not all jobs have that. Not all jobs UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 14 give the feeling that we\u2019re doing great things, we\u2019re going to be accomplishing things that will help the whole country, and I have missed that element. When that element isn\u2019t there and when you have that kind of a job early on, it spoils you for other kinds of work. And so that was a very good feeling for me to have at such a young age. Was it difficult to leave government work and the test site to move on to this new venture where\u2014? No, because the crux of that whole company really was connected with the site, because that\u2019s where REECo was, that\u2019s where EG& G\u2014 it was all so intertwined, it really didn\u2019t end. Because we partnered with the AEC, it really didn\u2019t seem that much different, because we still had the same interaction, although this was being formed as it went along because it was a totally new venture. But no, it was very much the same. I remained on REECo\u2019s payroll. Then when EG& G bought REECo, I think that was in 1968, that was just a continuation of the same group of companies. So it was like you were still in the same organization and the same galaxy. Yes. But you were moving on to a different planet, if that\u2014 Yes. Exactly. And our offices were up here on Flamingo Road. It was an office building. The MGM Hotel was not there, which is now Bally\u2019s, that was all desert. We had this three- story office building that now is not the Barbary Coast but it\u2019s one of those little [ 00: 35: 00] casinos there. Our offices were on the third floor of that building. And there were five of us that started. And we had very nice offices because we were having people from industry coming in to see us, and people in government and so forth. And so it was very groundbreaking, really. Very exciting. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 15 And how would you characterize your relationship with the two vice presidents? How would you see that working relationship? Well, it was quite, I guess I could use the word \u201c formal.\u201d It was always \u201c Mister\u201d and it was much more formal than here. And I would say they were very distinctively different men. Oh really? Yes. How so? One of them, Hal Aronson, was very orderly, very organized, documented everything, as you should, like trip reports. The other Continental Oil Company representative was a Ph. D. and scientific guy and was just the opposite. Sort of a brainy scientific guy, and you\u2019ve heard that some of them have their own way of working and don\u2019t follow any rules, and so that was interesting. And somewhere along the way, there would be conflict between them. And when I look back, I mean it worked pretty well for me, working [ for] both them for as long as I did. But\u2014 Why did it work well for you? I was able to stay out of the fray during the few periods of times when Hal would get very frustrated because Hank had been like six months behind in his trip reports. When I look back now it\u2019s pretty funny, and Hal and I have talked about this. And I think it\u2019s no different today than in offices where a lot of personalities, different personalities, have to work together. But it sounds like you had to be very flexible to be able to work with both of these guys, and then it also sounds like you kind of held it together. Yes. Well, I don\u2019t know if I did that or not. I know I was in- between there, and trying to give each the amount of attention that they deserved, and be fair. And then eventually I elected to go UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 16 to work for\u2014 when our company began to grow and we had a very, very fine, brilliant man who became the general counsel\u2014 John Berlinger, who has since passed away. And I wanted to learn about the legal angle, the legal aspects and the way the board of directors was formed and how it governed what we did and so forth. So I transferred and went to work for John and really enjoyed that. Were you almost like a paralegal? I don\u2019t know if I was at that level\u2014 but the thing that I wanted to [ do]\u2014 because there wasn\u2019t all that much legal research that needed to be done. However, one thing I really enjoyed was working closely with the board. And I remember on the list of officers, the very bottom officer was assistant secretary and that was who I was. I was so proud of that. I mean there\u2019s chairman of the board and president and so on, and down at the very bottom, that\u2019s where I was. But I really enjoyed it because you could be in on the really important stuff that was going on, and that was the board meetings. Oh, so you sat in on all the board meetings? Yes, and learned how to take minutes. And it sounds very simple and so forth. But John was a great, great teacher and a brilliant guy, and he was a very, very close friend of Herb\u2019s. Yes, really a wonderful man. [ 00: 40: 00] And is this how you came in contact with Herb Grier? Well, Herb being one of the original five. The two vice presidents, Herb, Jan, and myself, we were there in between this suite of offices, and I got to know him simply\u2014 he was Mr. Grier and this famous person, and so I was sort of like, Ooh, there goes Mr. Grier. And that\u2019s how I got to know him. So he had notoriety. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 17 Yes. I mean he was very in the community here and out in the world at large. In this realm of business, yes, he was a very highly respected guy. And then you started working for him, correct? Yes. His secretary, very long- time secretary, executive secretary, Jan, got married and moved away. And by that time, I worked for John Berlinger, for the general counsel. He told John\u2014 Jan wanted me to replace her. But my husband Bob\u2014 at this time Herb was also president of REECo\u2014 was budget officer for REECo. So he felt it was a conflict\u2014 my husband having that position, I shouldn\u2019t be working directly for him. He hired somebody from the outside and that did not work out. So when they had a new president, that\u2019s when he asked me to come to work for him. Why didn\u2019t the other work out, do you recall? [ Recording stopped for off the record remarks and then resumed]. It\u2019s interesting because people either in school hated shorthand and didn\u2019t get it or got it. I wasn\u2019t a straight- A student but shorthand was sort of fun because it was highly competitive in that you had to go faster and faster and faster. My teacher, Mrs. Carruth, was very good at [ it]\u2014 it was almost like being in a race. Then she\u2019d post all the grades up and they\u2019re like, well, I\u2019m the best in the class. But I\u2019ve kept that all through the years, not nearly as fast as I used to be. It\u2019s so funny that sometime I\u2019ll be jotting something down automatically, without even thinking of it, and somebody\u2019ll say, What is that? Is that Chinese? [ And I\u2019ll say] No, it\u2019s shorthand. [ And they\u2019ll say] What\u2019s shorthand? Yes, it\u2019s pretty funny. How many words a minute can you type? Oh, you know I forget what even the [ standard is]\u2014 I remember a hundred and twenty words a minute in shorthand was really good. In shorthand. But I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m very, very fast, but not UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 18 as fast as I used to be. There\u2019s really not much need to type a lot of stuff really fast these days, it seems, or at least in what I do it isn\u2019t. But back when you were working at the\u2014 Oh yes. You were typing all the time. And you\u2019d have sheets of carbon paper. Do you know what that is? Yes. OK. So you had copies of carbon paper, and every time you\u2019d make a mistake, you\u2019d have to erase and then\u2014 I mean erase very, very, very carefully so it didn\u2019t go all through the paper, and then erase all the carbons, and then type over it and keep going. Or rip it out and start all over again. So you said you started working for Herb Grier in the early 1970s? Or, I\u2019m sorry\u2014 Nineteen sixty- eight. OK, late 1960s. Yes. I remember when I spoke at his memorial service, one of the things that\u2014 you know for a man who accomplished as much as he did, he was very, very undemanding. I mean he required a level of excellence, absolutely, but in a very quiet way. But sometimes, I would do a letter or a memo or something, and it would be all done, and then he would want to change a word, and I\u2019d say, Well, OK, I\u2019ll retype it. And that\u2019s what you did then, you retyped it. And he said, No, no, no, that\u2019s OK. And he\u2019d sit and he\u2019d think and think and think, and then he would come up with a word that has exactly the same number of spaces to fit in the space of the word that was being taken out, so that I wouldn\u2019t have to retype the whole letter. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 19 So he had an appreciation for your job and he cared about not wanting to put you through extra\u2014 Yes. It\u2019s fortunate that\u2014 I was lucky to be able to have a pretty high level of my own standards, so that didn\u2019t happen too often\u2014 that I really fouled up on something. But he was very, very thoughtful, very, I say \u201c dignified,\u201d but he didn\u2019t make waves in an obvious way. He didn\u2019t like noise. He\u2019d didn\u2019t like furor. He didn\u2019t like lots of commotion that was uncivilized. He was very, very much a gentleman of the old school. Now were you ever anxious if you had made a mistake? Was he easy to go to? Oh yes. And because he was quiet and thoughtful I\u2019d go\u2014 once I even asked Dotty [ Dorothy Grier] when I didn\u2019t even know her that well but I liked her and respected her very, very much, Is Mr. Grier mad at me about something? She said, Peggy, I don\u2019t think so. He thinks you\u2019re just great. But it\u2019s my little bit of paranoia. [ 00: 05: 00] And he was so quiet. Yes, very quiet, very thoughtful, could sit and think and invent things in his mind by staring out the window for long periods of time. And then you would see that something, after those periods, something pretty significant would be coming forth, either in connection with his other activities\u2014 he always served on interesting boards, scientific companies, the bank. For a long time he was the chairman of the NASA [ National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, which was the panel that was established, made up after the Apollo fire. This is probably before you were born again, when the three of our astronauts were burned up in the space shuttle before it got off the ground. And NASA formed a panel of non- NASA scientists and engineers to bring an objective look, a fresh look, at everything that had to UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 20 do with our space travel\u2014 all the vehicles that were going up, to look at nuts and bolts and the very basics of\u2014 and that was very, very interesting. Now was he in the office a lot or it sounds like he was on different things. He was in the office a lot but he also was on travel a lot, principally New York, Boston, Washington, Los Angeles and Nevada. We had moved to La Jolla, California. Dotty and Herb, when Herb became sixty- five\u2014(and now it seems like he was like an older man and I\u2019m going to be sixty- five in two years.) Anyway, they decided when he reached mandatory retirement age at EG& G, where he had more freedom to live somewhere else, they looked around basically to get out of the heat and live maybe in a more moderate climate. So they looked in southern California, they looked around Carmel, Monterey. And it was necessary that Herb be near a sizeable airport because he did travel so much. So they found a home in La Jolla. It was almost completed, not quite. I always say this is the easiest sale that this salesman at Willis Allen Real Estate Company ever made in his life. Herb had driven all around La Jolla, made a bid on one house, then found this one, asked Dotty and me to go down and look at it, and then he said, OK, I\u2019ll buy that one. And so then they did work on it and moved into it. And he said, Would you like to move to La Jolla? And my girls and I had vacationed in La Jolla before. We liked to stay at the beach club. And my girls would say, Mom, this is so pretty here. Can we move here? I\u2019d say, Girls, I don\u2019t have a job here. And so as it turned out we moved down there. It was really difficult for my kids when it became an actuality because they were born here, raised here, were all involved in school activities, and they were in junior high school and high school, and that was tough. But they say now it brought to their attention how important it is when they see somebody who\u2019s out there and maybe lonely or maybe doesn\u2019t feel UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 21 they quite fit in, to make them feel welcome. And they say that was a very, very good experience for them. And so you moved in\u2014 when did you move to La Jolla? At the very end of 1977. So you had worked for him for quite a while. Yes, right, I\u2019d worked for him since 1968. [ Pause for telephone call] OK. Yes, so I had worked for him since 1968, and then I thought I wanted to continue my association with this unique job and unique person. And the person who replaced Herb asked me if I would stay at CER but it was a no- brainer as far as I was concerned. Herb had interesting involvements, he had interesting work, he worked at a very high level in each of these areas he was interested in, and La Jolla was a wonderful place to live. And it sounds like you developed quite a relationship with Herb and Dotty. I didn\u2019t know Dotty very well but I thought\u2014 she\u2019s a very quiet, brilliant, one of the smartest women I\u2019ve ever met in my life. I had a great deal of respect for her. She was not\u2014 and I had come into contact in other areas where the wife is very present in the work and very present in this and very present\u2014 Dotty was not. She was when Herb wanted her to get involved in some area , but she is first and foremost a lady, and I had great respect for her and affection for her, particularly as I got to know her better. And did you get to know her better when you were in La Jolla, do you think? Yes, a little bit more when I got to La Jolla. It wasn\u2019t as though we were pals, quote, pals. Nor Herb either. There was a very professional boss- subordinate relationship. But when I began to really get more involved with Dotty was when Herb died. Although actually I will back up on UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 22 that. When Herb went to part- time work, when he was winding down\u2014 he thought he would work for two years or so and then retire totally. Well, one of the things about him was people in the areas he was involved in didn\u2019t want him to [ retire]. I mean he would say, Well, I\u2019m going to. I think you should get somebody younger. They\u2019re all saying, Don\u2019t go! Please stay on our board. And that\u2019s very unusual. It\u2019s just the opposite of somebody who hangs on and hangs on, and then somebody, the board or whatever idiot thing, God, how do we get rid of him? In the corporate world. And so that went on. When he went to a part- time position\u2014 and I had to work full- time\u2014 we interviewed several ladies and selected one who had worked for SAIC, a similar company to EG& G but on a much smaller scale, and it\u2019s a very successful employee- owned company that was headquartered in La Jolla. Her name is Eileen. She came to work part- time. And then I moved back to Las Vegas because the president of the company that Herb had left had wanted me to go to work there. So I moved back to Las Vegas, and during that time Herb was still on the CER board, so he would come up frequently. I would go to La Jolla and stay with Herb and Dotty, visit them, and that is when I really got to know and have great affection for Dotty. So we became friends. And as our professional relationship with Herb changed, we became just very good friends. Oh really? Yes. Well, that\u2019s nice. That was nice that you were able to still maintain that relationship that they\u2014 Yes. And they were very strong forces in my life. As they got older, as they began to get older and Herb\u2014 well, they would come up here once a year. Herb would come up for board [ 00: 05: 00] meetings, and then Herb and Dotty would come up when we would invite the wives, like to the annual meeting. And then as their health problems began to be more serious, it UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 23 dawned on me, They\u2019re not going to be able, I don\u2019t think, to come up here very often. So I talked to a friend\u2014 I was and still am very close friends with the tax accountant for the Griers\u2014 I called Dominic and Kathy Daleida and said, Let\u2019s make a video of Las Vegas and send it to them so they\u2019ll see how the town is changing. So I rented a convertible and I borrowed a video camera and we drove all around town and out to Rancho Circle and showed them their old house, up and down the Strip, with narration and music and credits. I was the executive producer and director and Dominic was the\u2014 anyway, it was very, very fun to do and we put Viva Las Vegas, the theme music on it. Dotty\u2019s a pianist and she loves classical music, but whatever\u2014 there\u2019s no other theme music to have about a city, about Las Vegas. So anyway, that was very fun to do. And Dotty still shows it. So they really enjoyed it. They thought it was pretty funny. So how else were they influential in your life? One of the things I always think about Herb, with his quiet personality and demeanor, there was almost no question you could ask him about anything that he didn\u2019t know. And if I asked a question about astronomy or something, literally he was extremely well rounded. And most people didn\u2019t know that about him. They didn\u2019t know that he built engines, that he built clocks, that he loved watches. And he would build a clock that was that big. And each of his kids have one of the clocks, and there are two of the clocks that he built in the home. Maybe you\u2019ll see the home some day if Mary [ Palevsky] goes down there [ to the Grier home in La Jolla]. And it just dawned on me, one of the things that we are very excited about is one of the clocks, they called it a railroad clock, that is on the wall in the family room, it was from a railroad station in Massachusetts. It kept extremely accurate time. It was used out at the test site UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 24 as the time standard for detonating nuclear explosives. And Dotty is giving that to our museum. She told Troy, when Troy Wade and I first started\u2014 I always say Troy Wade because my daughter is Troy Bostian. And when Troy and I first started talking about interacting with Dotty and the museum we arranged to go down and meet with Dotty, she said, I want to give this to the museum, but not until I pass away. Because it\u2019s such a part of Herb and it has such wonderful chimes. That\u2019s great. So when you were first working for Herb, how long did it take before you felt comfortable in your working relationship? Gosh, time- wise, maybe a year. I don\u2019t think in any job I\u2019m ever one hundred percent comfortable. That\u2019s just not my nature. Like [ I think], Oh no, how am I going to get that done? You know. But probably a year. And that\u2019s when you kind of knew him well enough to know his little\u2014 because I know that whenever I\u2019ve worked for a boss, there are just certain things you don\u2019t do and you know that. It\u2019s because it\u2019s taken a while to develop that relationship, and some employers have been, what\u2019s the word for it, more extravagant than others with their needs and\u2014 Yes. Right, more needs. Well, that\u2019s interesting that you bring that up because one of the things that is different about him compared with other executives that I have known and know of is he didn\u2019t want you fluttering around him doing stuff for him. You know where some bosses their assistants are practically their servants. I mean they do all this personal stuff and go buy gifts for their wives and go take cleaning to the\u2014 Herb was very hands- off in that way. And again, I got very spoiled by that. So he [ Herb Grier] was able to maintain a professional life and a personal life and not make you a part\u2014 it sounds like you didn\u2019t have to organize his whole life for him. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 25 Exactly. Yes. Now I was involved in working closely with the outside accountants on all the financial business, all the bills. I had authority to sign very huge checks because he was an open, trusting guy. So he trusted you with the checkbook. Oh yes. Well, bills came in and then I\u2019d pay them and then he would get a summary and that was just sort of a given. And I have worked at other places where you might have signature authority for a thousand dollars. But it was his nature, he was just a very trusting guy. And I had [ a] very close working relationship with this Dominic Daleida who did the video with me, the outside accountant, and Latham and Watkins, the law firm. His name was Mr. Stevenson who was executor of Herb\u2019s estate then and worked closely on legal matters. And so it was a good team. And when you work at that level, even though I was not an accountant, I wasn\u2019t a lawyer, but when you work at the standard of excellence that he had in all areas, it makes you better at what you do. And in fact, Dominic is now retired. He and Kathy live up in the San Juan Islands in Washington State. And Dominic has one account, and that\u2019s Dotty Grier. He wanted to retire totally from accounting, but he is so glad that he has kept that account, particularly since Herb passed away. Yes. So you all developed these very strong ties and relationships. Yes. Absolutely we did. And we still. I\u2019m fortunate in that I still have this tie, these very strong ties, because they\u2019re very valuable in my life with Dotty. I miss seeing her as much as I used to, because Dotty\u2019s health hasn\u2019t been all that good. I would go down every, oh, every few weeks, every couple of months, because I wasn\u2019t working at all then, drive down, and then stay with Dotty, and we would go to movies, if there was a good play we\u2019d go to a play. We\u2019re both sort of foodies so we\u2019d be, What is the best restaurant that\u2019s opened up? Let\u2019s go there. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 26 And have fun. And since she has been not all that well and she\ufffd\ufffds learning to, quote, she calls it learning to walk again, because of this condition called neuropathy. Fortunately Herb\u2019s niece and her husband lived in Scripps Ranch\u2014 their house was one that was burned totally to the ground in the Scripps Ranch fire a couple of years ago\u2014 maybe it was last year. Yes, it was very recent. So the logical thing, because there\u2019s plenty of room, they moved into Dotty\u2019s house, which is very, very nice for Dotty because Lois and Rudy are taking very, very good care of her, and taking her to the doctor, and so that\u2019s been very, very valuable. Where are their kids? Herb, from his first marriage, has two children: Herbie, who lives in Colorado, and Joan, who lives in\u2014 she lived in Rancho Santa Fe and now she and George live in the Santa Inez Valley, where they are building a home and a ranch, because they raise Morgan horses. [ 00: 05: 00] Now did Dotty and Herb have kids, or\u2014? Dotty and Herb have one son, David. Brilliant young tall man like his dad, Ph. D., who works\u2014 I think he is a\u2014 his degree is in chemistry. And he and Karla and their two little boys live in northern California, and I can\u2019t remember the name of the town. It\u2019s above San Francisco somewhere. So but all the family is pretty much in California, it sounds like. Well, Colorado and\u2014 thank goodness Lois and Rudy in San Diego, and then Joan, even though she lives in Santa Inez, they get down to see Dotty quite frequently. That\u2019s good. Yes, it\u2019s really good. Now when you started working for Herb, you were still on the corporate payroll, right? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 27 Yes. So how did raises and vacation days and things like that work? Well, we sort of combined the best of all the companies: REECo, EG& G, and Continental. And basically when EG& G bought REECo we just had those procedures adopted for our own. And so it was pretty structured and in place, and that was pretty easy actually. Vacation days and sick days, we just followed the procedures manual first at REECo and then EG& G. So you would just accrue it. Yes. Right. And then how did raises work? Every year you got a review. And I remember my starting salary was $ 125.00 a week. And somewhere I have a sheet of paper that shows how much I made every year and so forth. And then you just got your review by your bosses and you got a raise. And it was almost sort of standard. Yes, you got a raise. And nowadays that isn\u2019t happening. And then there would be cost- of- living raises. And so you just worked your way up. Now when you were working for Herb, did he write you a review and give that to you or\u2014? Yes. How was that? I think it might\u2019ve been documented by a memo. I don\u2019t recall that we had standard, formal forms with a hundred questions on them. We probably did at some point a modified version, but being sort of an offshoot of EG& G/ REECo, we had some more flexibility than those huge companies did. In fact, I have a couple of the old memos that I particularly liked. One from John Berlinger when he made me assistant secretary because I was doing such a good job. My little office, down there at the very bottom of the list. And then your raise would be put in place. Much UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 28 to my surprise, EG& G was sold several years ago, and two years ago I received a check in the mail from Perk and Elmer , which was the company that bought a big section of EG& G, that was a retirement check that was something like five thousand dollars. When they had done the final, final closing- out and so forth, I guess there were some people they forgot. And it came at a particularly good time for me. It was sort of like fallen from heaven. I thought, that\u2019s very exact, because I never would\u2019ve even known the difference because when I left to go to work for Herb directly there was an accumulation and a calculation of the retirement benefits and the profit- sharing and so forth, and so that came out of the blue. That\u2019s great. Well, I think I\u2019m going to change\u2014 OK, so you started as\u2014 When I came back to CER from Las Vegas [ La Jolla], and it was funny because so many people would say, Peggy, you live in La Jolla. And you\u2019re coming back to Las Vegas? Anyway, but I was a working person, and so anyway I came back to CER Corporation, which had changed a lot, and the direction of the company was different without Herb there. I\u2019m not critical of that. It was just very different. So I came back and took my corporate secretary [ position], worked with the board, which I enjoyed very much, and then was made a vice president with corporate administration under me. So I was glad, having worked a long, long, long, long time, that I was able to go to the next level. That was good. I was glad I was able to do that. And how long did you stay in that position? I think for five years, and then the company was bought and greatly\u2014 they pared it down to I think there eventually were only five people there. A company out of Chicago bought the company. So some of us officers and so forth were\u2014 fortunately, my kids were out of college. I had gotten them through college. So my financial demands\u2014 it was a big change, but I thought, UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 29 I\u2019m not going to work for a while. And I think that\u2019s the first time since I was sixteen that I had not worked. So I thought, Well, I\u2019ll travel a little bit. And it was very hard to get used to. And fortunately, because my daughter worked for American Airlines, I could do some traveling, travel with her, which is really fun. In fact, we almost did this again. Like she had a trip out of San Jose. Mom, fly up Saturday. Sunday we\u2019ll fly to New York. I\u2019ve got a long layover. And then we\u2019ll come back. So I never had the flexibility before to do that, and thanks to being able to fly cheaply, I really was able to take advantage of that for a while. I still do, but it\u2019s more difficult. The passes aren\u2019t as generous. The flights aren\u2019t as\u2014 well, since 9/ 11 it\u2019s just very different. Troy was in New York on 9/ 11. She had been flying San Francisco- New York- San Francisco- Boston and\u2014 Did you just panic because those two American planes\u2014? Oh yes. Oh yes. And she was in New York for the whole following week because you know everybody was\u2014 it was\u2014 yes, when I got the phone call that she was fine, I was very, very relieved. Her little sister and I were very relieved. Yes. So you said you came back to work. How was the company different? How was the direction different than when Herb was there? The focus was entirely on oil and gas exploration. It was interesting in that the company had outreached to China. We were doing very, very interesting work with China. But because\u2014 to back up a little bit, the culture was very different because there were no more ties to EG& G or major companies. The principals bought almost all of the stock of the company, and so it was basically independently owned. Very small percentages were still owned by outside shareholders, but the majority was by the three principal men. So that was very, very different. [ 00: 05: 00] Yet I was able to be involved with some things that were very gratifying to me, and UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 30 that was establishing the profit- sharing plan and the\u2014 we were an ESOP company, employee stock ownership plan. I was in charge of working with the accountants and the lawyers and getting that established in the company. The 401(k) plan. A cafeteria plan. And I\u2019m not a lawyer but that was very gratifying because it was very, very important to our employees. I mean those replacing\u2014 I talked about earlier\u2014 having goals out there, like we were going to save the world and establish the Plowshare program. Well this, on a different level, was having goals out there and making the company, which was about fifty employees at that time, become like big companies and having the same benefits for our employees that large companies did. So I got a lot of satisfaction out of that. That\u2019s great! And a lot of experience. Lot of experience. Exactly. And learned a tremendous amount. And so in the last few years I haven\u2019t retained it all but it\u2019s a wide breadth of knowledge that is stuck in there, to some degree. And I really enjoyed that. Now is there anything about Herb that you would like to say that hasn\u2019t come out? Any memories or an event or anything? Well, it\u2019s interesting that you say that because when I spoke at his memorial service\u2014 which I was very nervous about doing when Dotty asked me if I would do that\u2014 I told you that there\u2019s almost nothing that he didn\u2019t have knowledge of, in a very quiet, understated way. And so I was always learning something. And the last thing I learned was about leukemia. He had been very ill, and I hadn\u2019t been down there for a while. The last picture that was taken of Herb and Dotty is when we were at dinner in La Jolla. And where I\u2019d learn a lot about space travel from him, I\u2019d learn a lot about clocks, about the weather, I mean he was just a fascinating guy and full of knowledge. Dominic and I had been talking back and forth. Dominic\u2019s the accountant up in UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 31 Washington now. Dominic said that he had talked with Jim Cowley, the executor and close attorney, that Herb was very, very sick, and I\u2019d call\u2014 [ Recording paused for phone call.] It struck me that the last conversation that I ever had, I learned something else. I had called down and was very surprised when Herb answered the phone, because he was very sick and they knew, Dotty had told me, he had come home from Scripps and he only had a few days left. So when Herb answered the phone I was quite surprised. And his voice was weak but I said, Hi, Herb. I hear something\u2019s going on down there. And he said, Yes, and then he explained to me how leukemia works. And I didn\u2019t inquire, I didn\u2019t. But he said, Well, the tests have gone from a white cell count should be this to this, and he\u2019s talking very slowly, and it went from this number way up high to this number, and then a scientific explanation of what was happening to him, which I thought was so like him. And so the last conversation I had about him was about what was killing him. And then his voice broke a little bit and he said, I\u2019m not feeling real [ well]\u2014 I\u2019ve got to go, Peggy, OK? And I said, Love you, Herb. And he said, OK, bye. And that\u2019s the last time I ever talked with him. And I thought it was so typical of him to not\u2014 he wasn\u2019t self- pitying, he wasn\u2019t\u2014 it was like: this is how this engine works. And he was just remarkable in that way. And he was going to understand it. Yes. Exactly. He knew exactly what was happening. And I thought I was so glad that I was able to maintain the relationship with Herb and Dotty, particularly the last years that I didn\u2019t work for him, and we became good friends. Yes, he was a significant force in having somebody of that UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 32 breadth in your life. And Dotty, who is understated and quiet and so forth, is very much the same way except she\u2019s\u2014 she was a perfect partner for him in that one of the reasons he fell in love with her was she was so darned smart and pretty and brilliant. And they met at Los Alamos. And so she was involved from a very early, at a very important, significant time as well. And Dotty was one of the first two women ever to observe a shot at the test site, and they observed the very first one, she and her friend from Los Alamos. So she\u2019s interesting. She\u2019s very interesting and Mary [ Palevsky] is going to like her very much. Well, I just have two more questions. One is in all of your experience with the test site and with your work, did you ever encounter any protesters? Yes, we encountered a lot of protesters up in Colorado. You know as I recall, and this was like from 1965 and then 1968 was Project Rulison and I think the next year was Project Rio Blanco and I can double- check those dates. But Colorado was very environmentally conscious, and good for them. But so many of them really did not want a nuclear explosion taking place in their back yard, and so those protesters were very visible. Just before the countdown, we found two of them coming through he woods, trying to get to ground zero at Project Rulison. So yes. Now I have not encountered any at the test site because I didn\u2019t work at the test site when the protests were going on. But just in Colorado. Right. Now did you travel out to Colorado when\u2014? Not a lot. In this corporate structure, in the structure we were in, you didn\u2019t just\u2014 my job didn\u2019t allow\u2014 I don\u2019t mean officially didn\u2019t allow, but you just didn\u2019t [ 00: 05: 00] do that. However, I UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 33 was at both shots, and I had an official role, which was taking the weather briefings, because I took shorthand. Every morning and evening, we would have weather briefings of all the different entities involved: the highway patrol, the weather bureau, the government officials. Every agency and office would be gathered around a table and we would have official weather briefings and elaborate\u2014 in the event the shot would what they call vent. And so it ended up being a big book like that [ Peggy, how big would you say the size of the book would be? ] and so that was again being at the hub of all this exciting activity. Now what was your opinion of the protesters? Did you have one or\u2014? I didn\u2019t think they were bad guys. I thought they were trying to delay our wonderful project but\u2014 and this is getting in the hippie days too\u2014 thought, well, there are always people who don\u2019t agree with what you\u2019re doing but I bet they\u2019re just a bunch of hippies. Looking back now, I think that\u2019s pretty na\u00efve, but it was\u2014 and we\u2019ve got some pictures that we can show you too, Shannon. That would be interesting. Yes. Somewhere there\u2019s some pictures of the protesters. And now just one more thing and then we\u2019re done. As far as your opinion and your take on nuclear energy and everything that was done, has it changed at all or are you still the same mindset as when you started working? I still think the Plowshare program and the good that nuclear energy can do is very, very, very valuable. But it\u2019s still and always will be very politically and environmentally controversial. But if ever we can safely conduct\u2014 and I don\ufffd\ufffdt know if that\u2019ll ever happen because I think there will always be accidents like Chernobyl. I think there\u2019s\u2014 and Troy Wade would be able to explain UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 34 this better than I can\u2014 I certainly don\u2019t think we ought to do atmospheric testing again. But using that tremendous power safely would be a dream. Yes. And you were able to see that. Yes. See the potential. Right. And you were at the hub of all these idea men that were coming up with all the different\u2014 Yes. And I miss that. That\u2019s part of what I enjoy here [ at the NTS Historical Foundation/ Atomic Testing Museum] is these idea men like Troy and the guys like Pete Zavattaro and the guys who worked in it. That\u2019s a very stimulating environment to be in. Even though I work part- time and we\u2019re not exploding bombs, it\u2019s reliving the history and preserving it. That\u2019s a wonderful project we have going here. Yes. Well, great. Well, thank you. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add? I can\u2019t think of right now, Shannon, but if I think of something, I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019ll call you, OK? OK, that would be great.",

The goal is to create an archive which adds relevant material to the existing historical record. Oral history recordings and transcripts are primary source material and do not represent the final, verified, or complete narrative of the events under discussion. Rather, oral history is a spoken remembrance or dialogue, reflecting the interviewee\u2019s memories, points of view and personal opinions about events in response to the interviewer\u2019s specific questions. Oral history interviews document each interviewee\u2019s personal engagement with the history in question. They are unique records, reflecting the particular meaning the interviewee draws from her/ his individual life experience. Produced by: The Nevada Test Site Oral History Project Departments of History and Sociology University of Nevada, Las Vegas, 89154- 5020 Director and Editor Mary Palevsky Principal Investigators Robert Futrell, Dept. of Sociology Andrew Kirk, Dept. of History The material in the Nevada Test Site Oral History Project archive is based upon work supported by the U.

Peggy Bostian: I moved here with my family. I was born in Washington state, in a beautiful, green trees Washington state. When I was fourteen years old, my family came to Las Vegas, this dry, flat, not green desert. And as we were driving\u2014 there were four kids in the family\u2014 I think it was through Salt Lake, we came down where you see Las Vegas, I thought, what have my parents done? This is a terrible place. It was in September so I immediately enrolled at Las Vegas High School, which at that time was the only public high school. Gorman, the Catholic high school, was just built, and so that was the only high school there was to go to. And once I got into meeting friends and so forth, Las Vegas became home. And so I graduated from high school in 1958. As a summer job, I worked at REECo, Reynolds Electrical and Engineering Company, as I think, a clerk- typist in purchasing, typing purchase orders. And I worked out at the test site on a temporary basis the following summer. During the school year, I\u2019d gone to Woodbury College in Los Angeles. Worked out at the [ Nevada] test site as a secretary to the head of personnel, and from there went to sort of working my way up. I went to work for the head of construction, which was a very interesting job. The most interesting was to work for Dr. Clinton S. Maupin, who\u2019s the father\u2014 just learned a few months ago\u2014 of one of our supreme court justices, Bill Maupin. Dr. Maupin was the head of health medicine and safety. RAD- SAFE, radiation safety department, was under Dr. Maupin. And he was always a member of the test panel, which every time there was a shot he\u2019d go out to UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 2 the control point, as was Troy [ Wade] a member. We have some pictures of Troy Wade looking up at the instruments and so forth. And I remember one day Dr. Maupin\u2014 we were young secretaries and we would sort of pester him and say, We would like to go to a shot. And this was in about 1961, 1962, 1963. He\u2019d sort of just brush us off and so forth. And then one day we all came to work and he said, Tomorrow we\u2019ll all go to see a shot. We have a little shot tomorrow. We said, Oh good. So we went out to the control point and that shot was Sedan, which was a phenomenal shot to see. Have you been out to the test site? Yes. The big crater? The enormous crater. He waited until we had a significant shot to see, and that was very, very thrilling. But he told you it was a little\u2014 Yes, OK, girls. And then you could call girls \u201c girls,\u201d you know. We were girls, practically, so it wasn\u2019t politically incorrect to say. We\u2019re going to go out to the-- OK. And I\u2019ve been so glad that I was able to be there and see that shot. Now did it cave in after? What it did, it raised up and sunk. It\u2019s what they call an excavation shot. And this was all part of the Plowshare program, the idea that you could build canals, the small power of a nuclear explosive could make these huge subsidence craters. So that was a big thrill. Now where were you standing when you saw that? How far away were you? [ 00: 05: 00] Very, very, very close. We were in a visitor trailer, as I recall, and, oh, probably, let me see, here we are on Flamingo Road. Probably at Kinko\u2019s [ 2- 3 blocks]. So pretty close. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 3 Yes, or maybe McCormick and Schmick, the restaurant. Yes, quite close. And did the earth shake? Did you feel that? Oh yes. And it made a noise. Oh really. Yes. Somewhere there might even be\u2014 I\u2019m sure there\u2019s videos but there might be audio as well. And I think that shot did what it was supposed to do. And the power that is so evident is pretty overwhelming. Really. Yes. So when you left, you felt overwhelmed by seeing that? It was very profound sense of what the power of a nuclear explosive can do. And it\u2019s interesting because Troy Wade assembled the device for that shot, and the device is what they called it instead of a bomb. But he did the assembly of that particular shot. And was he in there with you when\u2014? No, because he would be one of the ones at the Control Point panel literally controlling the setting- off, controlling the countdown and so forth, so they were in a more important and closer area than we were. Did you feel safe when the bomb went off? Yes, because we had been so familiar with test site activity, simply being residents of Las Vegas, even though I was very young, Well, that\u2019s the test site. They test bombs out there. And then you would see things in the paper and maybe your class would have a speaker come and talk about how safe everything was. Oh really? You had somebody come in when you were in high school? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 4 I went to school from 1954 to 1958, so I recall that somebody, maybe from AEC [ Atomic Energy Commission] or something, would come; this little booklet here [ showing booklet] was handed out. I had lost mine but one of my guy friends from school remembered that he had one of those little booklets and brought it to me. And one of our local citizens, prominent citizens in Nevada, particularly Las Vegas, her name is here, Thalia Dondero. She has just donated a bunch of these for us to sell in the [ Atomic Testing Museum] bookstore. [ Atomic Tests in Nevada, 1957, United States Atomic Energy Commission]. So you were exposed to this in high school. Yes, even though it wasn\u2019t like we studied it in great depth because it also was very, very, very classified. But we got used to it. And somebody\u2019s parents would work out at the test site, so it just became something we were familiar with. We didn\u2019t understand it all particularly; we were interested more in high school things than what was going on out there. Did you have drills at all? No. But a lot of my friends who were born here, who are a little older than I am, remember the duck- and- cover things and hiding under the desks. And I remember going out right after we moved here, going out six o\u2019clock in the morning or something and staring up north and you\u2019d see a flash of light and so forth. Now how did that impress you at that time? Without wholly understanding and being new to Nevada\u2014 it certainly wasn\u2019t as profound, even though it might\u2014 as seeing Sedan when I was a little older. But it was\u2014 and we didn\u2019t understand the real scientific significance or political. I was fourteen or fifteen years old. But it was something that I look back now and I\u2019m so glad that my parents [ 00: 10: 00] made us get up and watch. Some of my friends\u2019 parents would pile them in the car and drive up to somewhere UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 5 up closer to the test site. I think one of my friends said they would go up and park at Angel\u2019s Peak or something so they could really see. But you saw the flash of light and\u2014 Yes, I remember that, and I think after the first couple of times that we saw one of the shots we said, OK, well, we\u2019ve seen those. We don\u2019t need to see them anymore. I have to go to school now. So it was blas\u00e9? Yes. And here\u2019s someone like you, didn\u2019t know about the test site. And that was just\u2014 I don\u2019t remember the figures but I remember, if it\u2019s correct, that EG if they were sick. I believe we were able to use sick leave, our own sick leave, if I needed to stay home because one of my girls was ill or something. So I didn\u2019t get any sense\u2014 but 1951, that was like day one, as you said, so they were probably just forming policies and so forth. And I think too that a lot of things changed from the 1950s to the early 1960s. I think it was a real dramatic shift. Yes. Absolutely. But that\u2019s interesting that there was no\u2014 you didn\u2019t feel any kind of push or anything. No. Not at all. Well, that\u2019s really interesting. So now you start working at the Las Vegas office because you\u2019re not having to do that long commute. Right. And then from there where did you go to\u2014? Then I was approached by Hal Aronson, he\u2019s a member of our foundation, about going to work at CER Corporation, and Herb Grier was the president. He was the EG we called them secretaries and executive secretaries. And if you worked really hard, you could make your way up to be an administrative assistant. Oh really? That\u2019s interesting. So what were your duties when you started working for this other\u2014? Again, it was\u2014 oh, another piece of this CER Geonuclear Corporation was bringing in an industrial client like an oil company. The first one we worked with was called Austral Oil Company from Houston, Texas. They were the client. They had the property that they wanted developed. And so my job was as support to the two vice presidents who were working in bringing business in, coordinating with the AEC to get this project in Colorado off the ground. We would be working with officials in Colorado at the state, county and city level near where this project was going to be accomplished. And I don\u2019t know what to compare it to in the office today except if you\u2019ve been an executive secretary, it\u2019s sort of the same. The only difference is this was so unique and challenging and exciting. It was a job I enjoyed really very, very much. Was it due to the fact that there were new things coming up all the time? Well, it was more\u2014 that this was such a profound\u2014 it had such profound possibilities. Nobody had ever\u2014 I mean the Plowshare program had been in place for a while. There was a Project Gasbuggy, I think that was in New Mexico, and the experiments were for peaceful uses of nuclear explosives. And at that time, we hadn\u2019t been discouraged by the political aspects or the environmental aspects, reactions we were getting from the citizens of Colorado. It was all new and had great prospects. In fact, that feeling about working, not all jobs have that. Not all jobs UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 14 give the feeling that we\u2019re doing great things, we\u2019re going to be accomplishing things that will help the whole country, and I have missed that element. When that element isn\u2019t there and when you have that kind of a job early on, it spoils you for other kinds of work. And so that was a very good feeling for me to have at such a young age. Was it difficult to leave government work and the test site to move on to this new venture where\u2014? No, because the crux of that whole company really was connected with the site, because that\u2019s where REECo was, that\u2019s where EG& G\u2014 it was all so intertwined, it really didn\u2019t end. Because we partnered with the AEC, it really didn\u2019t seem that much different, because we still had the same interaction, although this was being formed as it went along because it was a totally new venture. But no, it was very much the same. I remained on REECo\u2019s payroll. Then when EG& G bought REECo, I think that was in 1968, that was just a continuation of the same group of companies. So it was like you were still in the same organization and the same galaxy. Yes. But you were moving on to a different planet, if that\u2014 Yes. Exactly. And our offices were up here on Flamingo Road. It was an office building. The MGM Hotel was not there, which is now Bally\u2019s, that was all desert. We had this three- story office building that now is not the Barbary Coast but it\u2019s one of those little [ 00: 35: 00] casinos there. Our offices were on the third floor of that building. And there were five of us that started. And we had very nice offices because we were having people from industry coming in to see us, and people in government and so forth. And so it was very groundbreaking, really. Very exciting. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 15 And how would you characterize your relationship with the two vice presidents? How would you see that working relationship? Well, it was quite, I guess I could use the word \u201c formal.\u201d It was always \u201c Mister\u201d and it was much more formal than here. And I would say they were very distinctively different men. Oh really? Yes. How so? One of them, Hal Aronson, was very orderly, very organized, documented everything, as you should, like trip reports. The other Continental Oil Company representative was a Ph. D. and scientific guy and was just the opposite. Sort of a brainy scientific guy, and you\u2019ve heard that some of them have their own way of working and don\u2019t follow any rules, and so that was interesting. And somewhere along the way, there would be conflict between them. And when I look back, I mean it worked pretty well for me, working [ for] both them for as long as I did. But\u2014 Why did it work well for you? I was able to stay out of the fray during the few periods of times when Hal would get very frustrated because Hank had been like six months behind in his trip reports. When I look back now it\u2019s pretty funny, and Hal and I have talked about this. And I think it\u2019s no different today than in offices where a lot of personalities, different personalities, have to work together. But it sounds like you had to be very flexible to be able to work with both of these guys, and then it also sounds like you kind of held it together. Yes. Well, I don\u2019t know if I did that or not. I know I was in- between there, and trying to give each the amount of attention that they deserved, and be fair. And then eventually I elected to go UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 16 to work for\u2014 when our company began to grow and we had a very, very fine, brilliant man who became the general counsel\u2014 John Berlinger, who has since passed away. And I wanted to learn about the legal angle, the legal aspects and the way the board of directors was formed and how it governed what we did and so forth. So I transferred and went to work for John and really enjoyed that. Were you almost like a paralegal? I don\u2019t know if I was at that level\u2014 but the thing that I wanted to [ do]\u2014 because there wasn\u2019t all that much legal research that needed to be done. However, one thing I really enjoyed was working closely with the board. And I remember on the list of officers, the very bottom officer was assistant secretary and that was who I was. I was so proud of that. I mean there\u2019s chairman of the board and president and so on, and down at the very bottom, that\u2019s where I was. But I really enjoyed it because you could be in on the really important stuff that was going on, and that was the board meetings. Oh, so you sat in on all the board meetings? Yes, and learned how to take minutes. And it sounds very simple and so forth. But John was a great, great teacher and a brilliant guy, and he was a very, very close friend of Herb\u2019s. Yes, really a wonderful man. [ 00: 40: 00] And is this how you came in contact with Herb Grier? Well, Herb being one of the original five. The two vice presidents, Herb, Jan, and myself, we were there in between this suite of offices, and I got to know him simply\u2014 he was Mr. Grier and this famous person, and so I was sort of like, Ooh, there goes Mr. Grier. And that\u2019s how I got to know him. So he had notoriety. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 17 Yes. I mean he was very in the community here and out in the world at large. In this realm of business, yes, he was a very highly respected guy. And then you started working for him, correct? Yes. His secretary, very long- time secretary, executive secretary, Jan, got married and moved away. And by that time, I worked for John Berlinger, for the general counsel. He told John\u2014 Jan wanted me to replace her. But my husband Bob\u2014 at this time Herb was also president of REECo\u2014 was budget officer for REECo. So he felt it was a conflict\u2014 my husband having that position, I shouldn\u2019t be working directly for him. He hired somebody from the outside and that did not work out. So when they had a new president, that\u2019s when he asked me to come to work for him. Why didn\u2019t the other work out, do you recall? [ Recording stopped for off the record remarks and then resumed]. It\u2019s interesting because people either in school hated shorthand and didn\u2019t get it or got it. I wasn\u2019t a straight- A student but shorthand was sort of fun because it was highly competitive in that you had to go faster and faster and faster. My teacher, Mrs. Carruth, was very good at [ it]\u2014 it was almost like being in a race. Then she\u2019d post all the grades up and they\u2019re like, well, I\u2019m the best in the class. But I\u2019ve kept that all through the years, not nearly as fast as I used to be. It\u2019s so funny that sometime I\u2019ll be jotting something down automatically, without even thinking of it, and somebody\u2019ll say, What is that? Is that Chinese? [ And I\u2019ll say] No, it\u2019s shorthand. [ And they\u2019ll say] What\u2019s shorthand? Yes, it\u2019s pretty funny. How many words a minute can you type? Oh, you know I forget what even the [ standard is]\u2014 I remember a hundred and twenty words a minute in shorthand was really good. In shorthand. But I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m very, very fast, but not UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 18 as fast as I used to be. There\u2019s really not much need to type a lot of stuff really fast these days, it seems, or at least in what I do it isn\u2019t. But back when you were working at the\u2014 Oh yes. You were typing all the time. And you\u2019d have sheets of carbon paper. Do you know what that is? Yes. OK. So you had copies of carbon paper, and every time you\u2019d make a mistake, you\u2019d have to erase and then\u2014 I mean erase very, very, very carefully so it didn\u2019t go all through the paper, and then erase all the carbons, and then type over it and keep going. Or rip it out and start all over again. So you said you started working for Herb Grier in the early 1970s? Or, I\u2019m sorry\u2014 Nineteen sixty- eight. OK, late 1960s. Yes. I remember when I spoke at his memorial service, one of the things that\u2014 you know for a man who accomplished as much as he did, he was very, very undemanding. I mean he required a level of excellence, absolutely, but in a very quiet way. But sometimes, I would do a letter or a memo or something, and it would be all done, and then he would want to change a word, and I\u2019d say, Well, OK, I\u2019ll retype it. And that\u2019s what you did then, you retyped it. And he said, No, no, no, that\u2019s OK. And he\u2019d sit and he\u2019d think and think and think, and then he would come up with a word that has exactly the same number of spaces to fit in the space of the word that was being taken out, so that I wouldn\u2019t have to retype the whole letter. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 19 So he had an appreciation for your job and he cared about not wanting to put you through extra\u2014 Yes. It\u2019s fortunate that\u2014 I was lucky to be able to have a pretty high level of my own standards, so that didn\u2019t happen too often\u2014 that I really fouled up on something. But he was very, very thoughtful, very, I say \u201c dignified,\u201d but he didn\u2019t make waves in an obvious way. He didn\u2019t like noise. He\u2019d didn\u2019t like furor. He didn\u2019t like lots of commotion that was uncivilized. He was very, very much a gentleman of the old school. Now were you ever anxious if you had made a mistake? Was he easy to go to? Oh yes. And because he was quiet and thoughtful I\u2019d go\u2014 once I even asked Dotty [ Dorothy Grier] when I didn\u2019t even know her that well but I liked her and respected her very, very much, Is Mr. Grier mad at me about something? She said, Peggy, I don\u2019t think so. He thinks you\u2019re just great. But it\u2019s my little bit of paranoia. [ 00: 05: 00] And he was so quiet. Yes, very quiet, very thoughtful, could sit and think and invent things in his mind by staring out the window for long periods of time. And then you would see that something, after those periods, something pretty significant would be coming forth, either in connection with his other activities\u2014 he always served on interesting boards, scientific companies, the bank. For a long time he was the chairman of the NASA [ National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, which was the panel that was established, made up after the Apollo fire. This is probably before you were born again, when the three of our astronauts were burned up in the space shuttle before it got off the ground. And NASA formed a panel of non- NASA scientists and engineers to bring an objective look, a fresh look, at everything that had to UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 20 do with our space travel\u2014 all the vehicles that were going up, to look at nuts and bolts and the very basics of\u2014 and that was very, very interesting. Now was he in the office a lot or it sounds like he was on different things. He was in the office a lot but he also was on travel a lot, principally New York, Boston, Washington, Los Angeles and Nevada. We had moved to La Jolla, California. Dotty and Herb, when Herb became sixty- five\u2014( and now it seems like he was like an older man and I\u2019m going to be sixty- five in two years.) Anyway, they decided when he reached mandatory retirement age at EG& G, where he had more freedom to live somewhere else, they looked around basically to get out of the heat and live maybe in a more moderate climate. So they looked in southern California, they looked around Carmel, Monterey. And it was necessary that Herb be near a sizeable airport because he did travel so much. So they found a home in La Jolla. It was almost completed, not quite. I always say this is the easiest sale that this salesman at Willis Allen Real Estate Company ever made in his life. Herb had driven all around La Jolla, made a bid on one house, then found this one, asked Dotty and me to go down and look at it, and then he said, OK, I\u2019ll buy that one. And so then they did work on it and moved into it. And he said, Would you like to move to La Jolla? And my girls and I had vacationed in La Jolla before. We liked to stay at the beach club. And my girls would say, Mom, this is so pretty here. Can we move here? I\u2019d say, Girls, I don\u2019t have a job here. And so as it turned out we moved down there. It was really difficult for my kids when it became an actuality because they were born here, raised here, were all involved in school activities, and they were in junior high school and high school, and that was tough. But they say now it brought to their attention how important it is when they see somebody who\u2019s out there and maybe lonely or maybe doesn\u2019t feel UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 21 they quite fit in, to make them feel welcome. And they say that was a very, very good experience for them. And so you moved in\u2014 when did you move to La Jolla? At the very end of 1977. So you had worked for him for quite a while. Yes, right, I\u2019d worked for him since 1968. [ Pause for telephone call] OK. Yes, so I had worked for him since 1968, and then I thought I wanted to continue my association with this unique job and unique person. And the person who replaced Herb asked me if I would stay at CER but it was a no- brainer as far as I was concerned. Herb had interesting involvements, he had interesting work, he worked at a very high level in each of these areas he was interested in, and La Jolla was a wonderful place to live. And it sounds like you developed quite a relationship with Herb and Dotty. I didn\u2019t know Dotty very well but I thought\u2014 she\u2019s a very quiet, brilliant, one of the smartest women I\u2019ve ever met in my life. I had a great deal of respect for her. She was not\u2014 and I had come into contact in other areas where the wife is very present in the work and very present in this and very present\u2014 Dotty was not. She was when Herb wanted her to get involved in some area , but she is first and foremost a lady, and I had great respect for her and affection for her, particularly as I got to know her better. And did you get to know her better when you were in La Jolla, do you think? Yes, a little bit more when I got to La Jolla. It wasn\u2019t as though we were pals, quote, pals. Nor Herb either. There was a very professional boss- subordinate relationship. But when I began to really get more involved with Dotty was when Herb died. Although actually I will back up on UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 22 that. When Herb went to part- time work, when he was winding down\u2014 he thought he would work for two years or so and then retire totally. Well, one of the things about him was people in the areas he was involved in didn\u2019t want him to [ retire]. I mean he would say, Well, I\u2019m going to. I think you should get somebody younger. They\u2019re all saying, Don\u2019t go! Please stay on our board. And that\u2019s very unusual. It\u2019s just the opposite of somebody who hangs on and hangs on, and then somebody, the board or whatever idiot thing, God, how do we get rid of him? In the corporate world. And so that went on. When he went to a part- time position\u2014 and I had to work full- time\u2014 we interviewed several ladies and selected one who had worked for SAIC, a similar company to EG& G but on a much smaller scale, and it\u2019s a very successful employee- owned company that was headquartered in La Jolla. Her name is Eileen. She came to work part- time. And then I moved back to Las Vegas because the president of the company that Herb had left had wanted me to go to work there. So I moved back to Las Vegas, and during that time Herb was still on the CER board, so he would come up frequently. I would go to La Jolla and stay with Herb and Dotty, visit them, and that is when I really got to know and have great affection for Dotty. So we became friends. And as our professional relationship with Herb changed, we became just very good friends. Oh really? Yes. Well, that\u2019s nice. That was nice that you were able to still maintain that relationship that they\u2014 Yes. And they were very strong forces in my life. As they got older, as they began to get older and Herb\u2014 well, they would come up here once a year. Herb would come up for board [ 00: 05: 00] meetings, and then Herb and Dotty would come up when we would invite the wives, like to the annual meeting. And then as their health problems began to be more serious, it UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 23 dawned on me, They\u2019re not going to be able, I don\u2019t think, to come up here very often. So I talked to a friend\u2014 I was and still am very close friends with the tax accountant for the Griers\u2014 I called Dominic and Kathy Daleida and said, Let\u2019s make a video of Las Vegas and send it to them so they\u2019ll see how the town is changing. So I rented a convertible and I borrowed a video camera and we drove all around town and out to Rancho Circle and showed them their old house, up and down the Strip, with narration and music and credits. I was the executive producer and director and Dominic was the\u2014 anyway, it was very, very fun to do and we put Viva Las Vegas, the theme music on it. Dotty\u2019s a pianist and she loves classical music, but whatever\u2014 there\u2019s no other theme music to have about a city, about Las Vegas. So anyway, that was very fun to do. And Dotty still shows it. So they really enjoyed it. They thought it was pretty funny. So how else were they influential in your life? One of the things I always think about Herb, with his quiet personality and demeanor, there was almost no question you could ask him about anything that he didn\u2019t know. And if I asked a question about astronomy or something, literally he was extremely well rounded. And most people didn\u2019t know that about him. They didn\u2019t know that he built engines, that he built clocks, that he loved watches. And he would build a clock that was that big. And each of his kids have one of the clocks, and there are two of the clocks that he built in the home. Maybe you\u2019ll see the home some day if Mary [ Palevsky] goes down there [ to the Grier home in La Jolla]. And it just dawned on me, one of the things that we are very excited about is one of the clocks, they called it a railroad clock, that is on the wall in the family room, it was from a railroad station in Massachusetts. It kept extremely accurate time. It was used out at the test site UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 24 as the time standard for detonating nuclear explosives. And Dotty is giving that to our museum. She told Troy, when Troy Wade and I first started\u2014 I always say Troy Wade because my daughter is Troy Bostian. And when Troy and I first started talking about interacting with Dotty and the museum we arranged to go down and meet with Dotty, she said, I want to give this to the museum, but not until I pass away. Because it\u2019s such a part of Herb and it has such wonderful chimes. That\u2019s great. So when you were first working for Herb, how long did it take before you felt comfortable in your working relationship? Gosh, time- wise, maybe a year. I don\u2019t think in any job I\u2019m ever one hundred percent comfortable. That\u2019s just not my nature. Like [ I think], Oh no, how am I going to get that done? You know. But probably a year. And that\u2019s when you kind of knew him well enough to know his little\u2014 because I know that whenever I\u2019ve worked for a boss, there are just certain things you don\u2019t do and you know that. It\u2019s because it\u2019s taken a while to develop that relationship, and some employers have been, what\u2019s the word for it, more extravagant than others with their needs and\u2014 Yes. Right, more needs. Well, that\u2019s interesting that you bring that up because one of the things that is different about him compared with other executives that I have known and know of is he didn\u2019t want you fluttering around him doing stuff for him. You know where some bosses their assistants are practically their servants. I mean they do all this personal stuff and go buy gifts for their wives and go take cleaning to the\u2014 Herb was very hands- off in that way. And again, I got very spoiled by that. So he [ Herb Grier] was able to maintain a professional life and a personal life and not make you a part\u2014 it sounds like you didn\u2019t have to organize his whole life for him. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 25 Exactly. Yes. Now I was involved in working closely with the outside accountants on all the financial business, all the bills. I had authority to sign very huge checks because he was an open, trusting guy. So he trusted you with the checkbook. Oh yes. Well, bills came in and then I\u2019d pay them and then he would get a summary and that was just sort of a given. And I have worked at other places where you might have signature authority for a thousand dollars. But it was his nature, he was just a very trusting guy. And I had [ a] very close working relationship with this Dominic Daleida who did the video with me, the outside accountant, and Latham and Watkins, the law firm. His name was Mr. Stevenson who was executor of Herb\u2019s estate then and worked closely on legal matters. And so it was a good team. And when you work at that level, even though I was not an accountant, I wasn\u2019t a lawyer, but when you work at the standard of excellence that he had in all areas, it makes you better at what you do. And in fact, Dominic is now retired. He and Kathy live up in the San Juan Islands in Washington State. And Dominic has one account, and that\u2019s Dotty Grier. He wanted to retire totally from accounting, but he is so glad that he has kept that account, particularly since Herb passed away. Yes. So you all developed these very strong ties and relationships. Yes. Absolutely we did. And we still. I\u2019m fortunate in that I still have this tie, these very strong ties, because they\u2019re very valuable in my life with Dotty. I miss seeing her as much as I used to, because Dotty\u2019s health hasn\u2019t been all that good. I would go down every, oh, every few weeks, every couple of months, because I wasn\u2019t working at all then, drive down, and then stay with Dotty, and we would go to movies, if there was a good play we\u2019d go to a play. We\u2019re both sort of foodies so we\u2019d be, What is the best restaurant that\u2019s opened up? Let\u2019s go there. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 26 And have fun. And since she has been not all that well and she\ufffd\ufffds learning to, quote, she calls it learning to walk again, because of this condition called neuropathy. Fortunately Herb\u2019s niece and her husband lived in Scripps Ranch\u2014 their house was one that was burned totally to the ground in the Scripps Ranch fire a couple of years ago\u2014 maybe it was last year. Yes, it was very recent. So the logical thing, because there\u2019s plenty of room, they moved into Dotty\u2019s house, which is very, very nice for Dotty because Lois and Rudy are taking very, very good care of her, and taking her to the doctor, and so that\u2019s been very, very valuable. Where are their kids? Herb, from his first marriage, has two children: Herbie, who lives in Colorado, and Joan, who lives in\u2014 she lived in Rancho Santa Fe and now she and George live in the Santa Inez Valley, where they are building a home and a ranch, because they raise Morgan horses. [ 00: 05: 00] Now did Dotty and Herb have kids, or\u2014? Dotty and Herb have one son, David. Brilliant young tall man like his dad, Ph. D., who works\u2014 I think he is a\u2014 his degree is in chemistry. And he and Karla and their two little boys live in northern California, and I can\u2019t remember the name of the town. It\u2019s above San Francisco somewhere. So but all the family is pretty much in California, it sounds like. Well, Colorado and\u2014 thank goodness Lois and Rudy in San Diego, and then Joan, even though she lives in Santa Inez, they get down to see Dotty quite frequently. That\u2019s good. Yes, it\u2019s really good. Now when you started working for Herb, you were still on the corporate payroll, right? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 27 Yes. So how did raises and vacation days and things like that work? Well, we sort of combined the best of all the companies: REECo, EG& G, and Continental. And basically when EG& G bought REECo we just had those procedures adopted for our own. And so it was pretty structured and in place, and that was pretty easy actually. Vacation days and sick days, we just followed the procedures manual first at REECo and then EG& G. So you would just accrue it. Yes. Right. And then how did raises work? Every year you got a review. And I remember my starting salary was $ 125.00 a week. And somewhere I have a sheet of paper that shows how much I made every year and so forth. And then you just got your review by your bosses and you got a raise. And it was almost sort of standard. Yes, you got a raise. And nowadays that isn\u2019t happening. And then there would be cost- of- living raises. And so you just worked your way up. Now when you were working for Herb, did he write you a review and give that to you or\u2014? Yes. How was that? I think it might\u2019ve been documented by a memo. I don\u2019t recall that we had standard, formal forms with a hundred questions on them. We probably did at some point a modified version, but being sort of an offshoot of EG& G/ REECo, we had some more flexibility than those huge companies did. In fact, I have a couple of the old memos that I particularly liked. One from John Berlinger when he made me assistant secretary because I was doing such a good job. My little office, down there at the very bottom of the list. And then your raise would be put in place. Much UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 28 to my surprise, EG& G was sold several years ago, and two years ago I received a check in the mail from Perk and Elmer , which was the company that bought a big section of EG& G, that was a retirement check that was something like five thousand dollars. When they had done the final, final closing- out and so forth, I guess there were some people they forgot. And it came at a particularly good time for me. It was sort of like fallen from heaven. I thought, that\u2019s very exact, because I never would\u2019ve even known the difference because when I left to go to work for Herb directly there was an accumulation and a calculation of the retirement benefits and the profit- sharing and so forth, and so that came out of the blue. That\u2019s great. Well, I think I\u2019m going to change\u2014 OK, so you started as\u2014 When I came back to CER from Las Vegas [ La Jolla], and it was funny because so many people would say, Peggy, you live in La Jolla. And you\u2019re coming back to Las Vegas? Anyway, but I was a working person, and so anyway I came back to CER Corporation, which had changed a lot, and the direction of the company was different without Herb there. I\u2019m not critical of that. It was just very different. So I came back and took my corporate secretary [ position], worked with the board, which I enjoyed very much, and then was made a vice president with corporate administration under me. So I was glad, having worked a long, long, long, long time, that I was able to go to the next level. That was good. I was glad I was able to do that. And how long did you stay in that position? I think for five years, and then the company was bought and greatly\u2014 they pared it down to I think there eventually were only five people there. A company out of Chicago bought the company. So some of us officers and so forth were\u2014 fortunately, my kids were out of college. I had gotten them through college. So my financial demands\u2014 it was a big change, but I thought, UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 29 I\u2019m not going to work for a while. And I think that\u2019s the first time since I was sixteen that I had not worked. So I thought, Well, I\u2019ll travel a little bit. And it was very hard to get used to. And fortunately, because my daughter worked for American Airlines, I could do some traveling, travel with her, which is really fun. In fact, we almost did this again. Like she had a trip out of San Jose. Mom, fly up Saturday. Sunday we\u2019ll fly to New York. I\u2019ve got a long layover. And then we\u2019ll come back. So I never had the flexibility before to do that, and thanks to being able to fly cheaply, I really was able to take advantage of that for a while. I still do, but it\u2019s more difficult. The passes aren\u2019t as generous. The flights aren\u2019t as\u2014 well, since 9/ 11 it\u2019s just very different. Troy was in New York on 9/ 11. She had been flying San Francisco- New York- San Francisco- Boston and\u2014 Did you just panic because those two American planes\u2014? Oh yes. Oh yes. And she was in New York for the whole following week because you know everybody was\u2014 it was\u2014 yes, when I got the phone call that she was fine, I was very, very relieved. Her little sister and I were very relieved. Yes. So you said you came back to work. How was the company different? How was the direction different than when Herb was there? The focus was entirely on oil and gas exploration. It was interesting in that the company had outreached to China. We were doing very, very interesting work with China. But because\u2014 to back up a little bit, the culture was very different because there were no more ties to EG& G or major companies. The principals bought almost all of the stock of the company, and so it was basically independently owned. Very small percentages were still owned by outside shareholders, but the majority was by the three principal men. So that was very, very different. [ 00: 05: 00] Yet I was able to be involved with some things that were very gratifying to me, and UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 30 that was establishing the profit- sharing plan and the\u2014 we were an ESOP company, employee stock ownership plan. I was in charge of working with the accountants and the lawyers and getting that established in the company. The 401( k) plan. A cafeteria plan. And I\u2019m not a lawyer but that was very gratifying because it was very, very important to our employees. I mean those replacing\u2014 I talked about earlier\u2014 having goals out there, like we were going to save the world and establish the Plowshare program. Well this, on a different level, was having goals out there and making the company, which was about fifty employees at that time, become like big companies and having the same benefits for our employees that large companies did. So I got a lot of satisfaction out of that. That\u2019s great! And a lot of experience. Lot of experience. Exactly. And learned a tremendous amount. And so in the last few years I haven\u2019t retained it all but it\u2019s a wide breadth of knowledge that is stuck in there, to some degree. And I really enjoyed that. Now is there anything about Herb that you would like to say that hasn\u2019t come out? Any memories or an event or anything? Well, it\u2019s interesting that you say that because when I spoke at his memorial service\u2014 which I was very nervous about doing when Dotty asked me if I would do that\u2014 I told you that there\u2019s almost nothing that he didn\u2019t have knowledge of, in a very quiet, understated way. And so I was always learning something. And the last thing I learned was about leukemia. He had been very ill, and I hadn\u2019t been down there for a while. The last picture that was taken of Herb and Dotty is when we were at dinner in La Jolla. And where I\u2019d learn a lot about space travel from him, I\u2019d learn a lot about clocks, about the weather, I mean he was just a fascinating guy and full of knowledge. Dominic and I had been talking back and forth. Dominic\u2019s the accountant up in UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 31 Washington now. Dominic said that he had talked with Jim Cowley, the executor and close attorney, that Herb was very, very sick, and I\u2019d call\u2014 [ Recording paused for phone call.] It struck me that the last conversation that I ever had, I learned something else. I had called down and was very surprised when Herb answered the phone, because he was very sick and they knew, Dotty had told me, he had come home from Scripps and he only had a few days left. So when Herb answered the phone I was quite surprised. And his voice was weak but I said, Hi, Herb. I hear something\u2019s going on down there. And he said, Yes, and then he explained to me how leukemia works. And I didn\u2019t inquire, I didn\u2019t. But he said, Well, the tests have gone from a white cell count should be this to this, and he\u2019s talking very slowly, and it went from this number way up high to this number, and then a scientific explanation of what was happening to him, which I thought was so like him. And so the last conversation I had about him was about what was killing him. And then his voice broke a little bit and he said, I\u2019m not feeling real [ well]\u2014 I\u2019ve got to go, Peggy, OK? And I said, Love you, Herb. And he said, OK, bye. And that\u2019s the last time I ever talked with him. And I thought it was so typical of him to not\u2014 he wasn\u2019t self- pitying, he wasn\u2019t\u2014 it was like: this is how this engine works. And he was just remarkable in that way. And he was going to understand it. Yes. Exactly. He knew exactly what was happening. And I thought I was so glad that I was able to maintain the relationship with Herb and Dotty, particularly the last years that I didn\u2019t work for him, and we became good friends. Yes, he was a significant force in having somebody of that UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 32 breadth in your life. And Dotty, who is understated and quiet and so forth, is very much the same way except she\u2019s\u2014 she was a perfect partner for him in that one of the reasons he fell in love with her was she was so darned smart and pretty and brilliant. And they met at Los Alamos. And so she was involved from a very early, at a very important, significant time as well. And Dotty was one of the first two women ever to observe a shot at the test site, and they observed the very first one, she and her friend from Los Alamos. So she\u2019s interesting. She\u2019s very interesting and Mary [ Palevsky] is going to like her very much. Well, I just have two more questions. One is in all of your experience with the test site and with your work, did you ever encounter any protesters? Yes, we encountered a lot of protesters up in Colorado. You know as I recall, and this was like from 1965 and then 1968 was Project Rulison and I think the next year was Project Rio Blanco and I can double- check those dates. But Colorado was very environmentally conscious, and good for them. But so many of them really did not want a nuclear explosion taking place in their back yard, and so those protesters were very visible. Just before the countdown, we found two of them coming through he woods, trying to get to ground zero at Project Rulison. So yes. Now I have not encountered any at the test site because I didn\u2019t work at the test site when the protests were going on. But just in Colorado. Right. Now did you travel out to Colorado when\u2014? Not a lot. In this corporate structure, in the structure we were in, you didn\u2019t just\u2014 my job didn\u2019t allow\u2014 I don\u2019t mean officially didn\u2019t allow, but you just didn\u2019t [ 00: 05: 00] do that. However, I UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 33 was at both shots, and I had an official role, which was taking the weather briefings, because I took shorthand. Every morning and evening, we would have weather briefings of all the different entities involved: the highway patrol, the weather bureau, the government officials. Every agency and office would be gathered around a table and we would have official weather briefings and elaborate\u2014 in the event the shot would what they call vent. And so it ended up being a big book like that [ Peggy, how big would you say the size of the book would be? ] and so that was again being at the hub of all this exciting activity. Now what was your opinion of the protesters? Did you have one or\u2014? I didn\u2019t think they were bad guys. I thought they were trying to delay our wonderful project but\u2014 and this is getting in the hippie days too\u2014 thought, well, there are always people who don\u2019t agree with what you\u2019re doing but I bet they\u2019re just a bunch of hippies. Looking back now, I think that\u2019s pretty na\u00efve, but it was\u2014 and we\u2019ve got some pictures that we can show you too, Shannon. That would be interesting. Yes. Somewhere there\u2019s some pictures of the protesters. And now just one more thing and then we\u2019re done. As far as your opinion and your take on nuclear energy and everything that was done, has it changed at all or are you still the same mindset as when you started working? I still think the Plowshare program and the good that nuclear energy can do is very, very, very valuable. But it\u2019s still and always will be very politically and environmentally controversial. But if ever we can safely conduct\u2014 and I don\ufffd\ufffdt know if that\u2019ll ever happen because I think there will always be accidents like Chernobyl. I think there\u2019s\u2014 and Troy Wade would be able to explain UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 34 this better than I can\u2014 I certainly don\u2019t think we ought to do atmospheric testing again. But using that tremendous power safely would be a dream. Yes. And you were able to see that. Yes. See the potential. Right. And you were at the hub of all these idea men that were coming up with all the different\u2014 Yes. And I miss that. That\u2019s part of what I enjoy here [ at the NTS Historical Foundation/ Atomic Testing Museum] is these idea men like Troy and the guys like Pete Zavattaro and the guys who worked in it. That\u2019s a very stimulating environment to be in. Even though I work part- time and we\u2019re not exploding bombs, it\u2019s reliving the history and preserving it. That\u2019s a wonderful project we have going here. Yes. Well, great. Well, thank you. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add? I can\u2019t think of right now, Shannon, but if I think of something, I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019ll call you, OK? OK, that would be great.",

The goal is to create an archive which adds relevant material to the existing historical record. Oral history recordings and transcripts are primary source material and do not represent the final, verified, or complete narrative of the events under discussion. Rather, oral history is a spoken remembrance or dialogue, reflecting the interviewee\u2019s memories, points of view and personal opinions about events in response to the interviewer\u2019s specific questions. Oral history interviews document each interviewee\u2019s personal engagement with the history in question. They are unique records, reflecting the particular meaning the interviewee draws from her/ his individual life experience.

Suzanne Becker: Go right ahead. Robert Curran: You need my name? Yes. My name is Robert Joseph Curran. I was born August 31, 1934 in St. Louis, Missouri. OK. Talk a little bit about your childhood, some of the things that we\u2019ve been talking about. OK, well, I always considered myself a representative of the development of the middle class because when I was born, I was born in a four- family flat, rear entry, upper level, brick, no air conditioning, of course, no central heating, no hot water, in which my mother cooked on a coal stove. Not a gas stove, not an electric stove. Coal. You put coal in there. Which we had little coal heaters. And it was what you call a \u201c shotgun house,\u201d which we could shoot a shotgun in the front door and it\u2019d go out the back. Right. It\u2019s one of those long houses. Right, long. And we had an icebox, not a refrigerator. My father was a bellhop in a hotel. My mother was a hairdresser who ran away on July 4, 1925, Pontiac, Illinois, and got married. And I\u2019m the youngest of three children. OK. And what are your siblings\u2019 names? My sibling Doris Elizabeth, who is better known as Sister Mary Denis, who is a nun. She is seven years older than I am. And my brother is Thomas Patrick, and he is a retired chief technical writer for Martin Marietta Corporation. But he\u2019s five years older than me and he\u2019s retired. I\u2019m the baby. And that\u2019s it. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 2 And did you grow up in St. Louis? Lived my entire youth and life in St. Louis and I moved when I was like thirty- eight but I\u2019m still in St. Louis, basically. I became the prosecutor of Jefferson County in 1973, which is the county south of St. Louis. It\u2019s a long story, but their prosecutor went full- time and I was an assistant prosecutor in St. Louis. I knew a number of the lawyers and judges, and even though it was an elective office, everybody agreed that they would file no lawsuits if I would take the job. And really turned the office from a part- time office to a professional. And I did it for two years and then I wound up going on the bench down there. I was judge down there for twenty years and I lived there. And recently we decided we didn\u2019t need the big home anymore and we sold it and moved back to St. Louis, where I can take a bus to work. Very nice. I want to back up from that point because that takes us to the present, but I want to go back to when you were a kid because that\u2019s really interesting. A couple of things. I\u2019m wondering if you could describe what it was like growing up in that time period. Well, of course, I\u2019m old enough to remember the beginning of World War II, because I would\u2019ve been seven. I can identify that with the fact that in September of \u2019 41 Stan Musial, my favorite all- time baseball player, came up to the major leagues, and being left- handed and Stan\u2019s left- handed, was my idol. And I remember that vividly. My dad getting upset because I was seven, a little brat running around, and telling me to shut up because what was on the radio was so important, and we\u2019re talking about December 7, \u2019 41. So he was trying to listen. I think I gave you some of my American Legion oratory, and a lot of the\u2014 not pro- military, that\u2019s not exactly what I\u2019m talking to, but the service- to- country type of thing. World War II was a lot different because, we always\u2014 these guys go over to Iraq for eight months, which is tough, UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 3 but those guys went over like for four years, and they were gone, their families grew, everything. And so I sort of grew up. I would\u2019ve been seven when it started, eleven when it ended\u2014 So you have a pretty good awareness of it. Yeah, and about the same time my dad was founding the Hotel Workers\u2019 Union in St. Louis\u2014 Talk about your dad a little bit. What did he do? My dad started out\u2014 I love the fact they ran away and got married because your parents never do anything like that. You know that, don\u2019t you? [ 00: 05: 00] Right. That\u2019s pretty wild for that\u2014 Pretty wild. And nobody even knew they were married for two years, until my sister came along, and then they had to admit it. But anyhow, so they didn\u2019t get married because they had to get married. Right, they were already married. They were already married. My dad was born in Atlanta, Georgia, came to St. Louis when he was like eleven years old, and at sixteen he had to drop out of high school with my mother, got one semester of high school, which was a lot in those days. They were both born in \u2019 02 [ 1902]. My mother was very bright, but in those days the old German kinder, k\u00fcche, kirche. Do you know what those are? No. OK. Kinder is children, kirche is church, k\u00fcche is kitchen. That was the women. My father was Irish, so he was a little more liberated than the old Germans that I grew up with. But the richest kid we knew in our class in grade school was the one who owned their own house, because his father worked for the Post Office. My dad came along and founded the union and got into politics and in 1944 ran for state legislature and was elected. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 4 Now, he was a bellhop at the hotel, is that what you said? Before he founded the union, then he was president of the union and business agent for the union. So that\u2019s pretty remarkable. Yes. And if you look back, I\u2019ve got the books about him, he was educated in parochial schools and then he went to labor college, not\u2014 never got at GED or anything\u2014 he just went there to take courses at St. Louis University, and he became an expert on labor law. That\u2019s amazing. And he gets elected to the \u2019 44 legislature and becomes a member of the commission that adopted the 1945 constitution for the State of Missouri. Really. So he had a hand in that. He had a hand in that. Because the joke always was, they made what was then justices of the peace, magistrate judges, and they had to be a lawyer. And they always said he was making a job for me, because I was Danny Curran\u2019s lawyer. Everybody called me that when I was a little boy. And you want to know what type of judge I was? I was an associate circuit judge, which was the one that evolved. So he did make a job for me, as it turned out. Now, you used to spend a lot of time with him at the legislature? Yeah, I was at the legislature. When you were a kid? Yes. And my dad was a professional boxer also when he was young. Oh, really! And so I used to go down to the gym with him when I was upper grade school, early high school. Dan O\u2019Keefe, who was a fireman, used to teach me how to box. Now, the side story is that I used UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 5 to always play handball with a man whose name I thought was Tony Pip. He was an Italian guy, he liked to lose weight, because I made him run, I was [ a] kid, and he used to buy me ice cream. In 1950 I\u2019m sitting watching television and the Kefauver Committee on crime is there and they say, Would Anthony La Pippararo take the stand? And this guy was the head of the St. Louis Mafia. I had no idea. If I\u2019d known, I wouldn\u2019t have gone to have ice cream. I was liable to get blown up. But the joke always was, if somebody had ever touched me, they were in trouble with the Mob. But anyhow, yeah, I grew up a poor boy. What was your mom\u2019s name? Helen Eckhardt. She was German. I always said she\u2019s the only woman of German parentage that had three children that were 100 percent Irish. Yeah, and after my dad died, my mother went to work. She was probably the biggest baseball fan ever. And my mother and dad used to go\u2014 after we were all in college, I\u2019m the youngest. I mean do you realize how rare it was in those days to have three kids and they\u2019re all college graduates? [ 00: 10: 00] Well, yes. I think part of that is what you were talking about earlier with the rise of the middle class, and you were part of that. My dad once said, if he could make $ 100 a week for the rest of his life, he\u2019d be satisfied. I make $ 83 an hour. OK? That\u2019s a pretty good job. But you know what I\u2019m saying. Well, you\u2019ve far exceeded\u2014 I give myself in the context of what we were dealing with. It\u2019s just to get you in context of what we were dealing with there. Absolutely. Well, different times. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 6 Different times than what you are dealing with now. But, my parents never owned a home; lived in apartments, all their lives, and when my dad died at fifty- five, my mother had to go to work because she couldn\u2019t do it. What year did your father\u2014? Fifty- seven. See, this is going to come into here because he was alive when I was out here. So let\u2019s work up to that. So obviously you went to high school and college. Where\u2019d you go to college? I went to a Catholic boys\u2019 high school. And get it in context. My sister was number two in her class. My brother was number two in the class. Freshman year, I\u2019m number one in my class. So you guys are pretty good students. So second year, I letter in three sports. I lettered in track, which I lettered in all four years. I lettered in baseball, and I lettered in boxing\u2014 which you remember I said I had done that\u2014 we had a boxing team. Now, my sophomore year, I was like number five in the class, but my junior year I\u2019m number one and my senior [ year] number one, and overall I\u2019m number two because I had to show I wasn\u2019t a brain, if you know what I mean. Everybody [ thinks] you\u2019re on this other planet. Now, I\u2019m not ashamed of it. When you\u2019re a kid, fifteen years old, it\u2019s like you know everybody\u2014 and the weird thing, when I went to my fiftieth high school anniversary, everybody there thinks I was number one in the class, and I wasn\u2019t. I was number two. Well, I\u2019d say that\u2019s still pretty good standing. And I think you\u2019ve got like\u2014 you see a lot of what I did in high school. It was pretty amazing. I was extemporaneous speaker. I was a debater. I was American Legion oratory. I was Voice of Democracy. And I have a nice little medal from St. Mary\u2019s High School for all- around speech UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 7 performances. I could write a little bit at that time. Wrote an essay on religious vocations that won the State of Missouri when I was in high school. So I was a hot dog. I was a little bit of a hot dog. But I was, now you\u2019re not ashamed to say it, an intellectual hot dog. Well that\u2019s not a bad thing. No, not a bad thing. But, you know, maybe some of this macho stuff, Mary [ Vincent Ward] and I were talking about it, about being out here at the blast and volunteering to jump out of airplanes and that, was a little hiding the intellectualism that was running around that background. Keep it under wraps a little. Keep it under wraps so nobody knew about it. Now, you were ROTC [ Reserve Officer Training Corps], correct? Right. And what inspired you to do that? Just good for college? I think $ 27.50 a month was part of it. When I graduated from high school in \u2019 52, four guys out of my class went right into the military and were killed within four months in Korea, which gives you an indication of the times. And anyhow, I wanted to go to college. I was the youngest of three. My sister was already going to college. My brother was already going to college. The question of my family to me is, where are you going to college and what are you going to study? Right. So you were going to college. I was younger. My girls, my daughters had the same thing. Nobody ever asked them if they were going. They just went. They went. And so by the time they got to me, it was a given, and a good little Catholic boy went to \u201c Mizzou,\u201d the University of Missouri, which was verboten in those days because you were UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 8 supposed to go to a Catholic college, and I was sort of revolutionary. And the story I remember [ 00: 15: 00] on that was my senior year, I had written this essay that had won the state on the importance of religious vocations, and the Brothers of Mary were all trying to talk to me about what I should really do in this world; I said no, I want to be a lawyer. Anyhow, and I got in bad trouble because they had a panty raid at Mizzou about April of my senior year, and this one brother had really been talking to me, and I got the paper that morning, I threw it on his desk, about the panty raid, and I said, Now, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going. And he wanted to throw me out. I was a little cocky. Yeah. So you were in a fraternity? Yeah. It was a Catholic fraternity which is now Phi Kappa Theta. It was Phi Kappa; it\u2019s now Phi Kappa Theta. But that\u2019s the only way my parents would let me go is that you join the Catholic fraternity where I was sure about you. You\u2019ve got to remember, I have a sister that\u2019s a nun at this time, and that was it. And I really learned more about drinking beer than I did about going to church. But we won\u2019t talk about that. College, I was a very average student. I didn\u2019t excel academically or anything like that, and I never have understood why. One semester, I didn\u2019t even buy any books. All sorts of different things going on. You know, why, just everything was going on, and I don\u2019t know. And about that time, I found I had an arrhythmatic heart which people thought it was going to kill me by the time I\u2019m thirty and I\u2019m sitting here nearly seventy- one, so it didn\u2019t. But anyhow, I don\u2019t know, maybe that\u2019s where I started getting onto being Mr. Daring\u2014 When you found out about the heart. Because I didn\u2019t care. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 9 So now, you\u2019re ROTC and you graduated college and you went into the military? Yes. And where did you first end up? Went down to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, which was the artillery officers\u2019 training. Fort Sill? Yeah, Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Fort Bliss is going to come later. Fort Sill, Oklahoma is the artillery. So you started there\u2014 And I got there and I remember we all got our orders and some guys were going to Korea, even though the war was over officially. And I get Fort Lewis, Washington, which was at one time the port of embarkation to Korea, and I figured I was going over. I remember having a few drinks that night, because we all thought we were going over to Korea and I was, well, if I\u2019m out the next morning, I wasn\u2019t. And I go up there. I\u2019m assigned what they call a \u201c bastard battalion.\u201d It wasn\u2019t assigned to a division artillery [ battalion], field artillery battalion, 155 howitzer, it was assigned to Sixth Army. So I\u2019m assigned to that and I have this wonderful winter in the rain up at Fort Lewis, out in the field doing all kinds of things, and we\u2019re a service battery, so basically we\u2019re transporting artillery rounds. We weren\u2019t really firing guns that much. And comes the spring and you\u2014 oh! And I met a colonel while I was there, Colonel Powell, and I can\u2019t think of his first name. I know where he\u2019s buried; I could take you to Arlington [ National] Cemetery and show you his burial place, but I can\u2019t think of his first name, which I think is the first sign of old age. But anyhow, when I walked in and reported, I remember vividly being in Rawlins, Wyoming on the way, in a snowstorm, trying to get St. Louis radio to find out if my father had won the election. I mean it was the \u2019 56 election. And I get up there like a day or two later and Colonel Powell says, Lieutenant, do you have a car? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 10 I said, Yeah, it\u2019s out there. I had a \u201c Stevenson for President\u201d sticker. And he says to me, You picked the wrong man. And I said, No, I picked the right man. The people picked the wrong man. At which time he laughed and he said, Are you a lawyer? And I said, No, I\u2019m going to be one. And he was a friend of Melvin Belli\u2019s, who is a very famous lawyer from San Francisco. Very famous lawyer from San Francisco. So he and I used to talk all the time. And his daughter came up one time for a dance and, eh, single lieutenant, she was little, I was little, take her out. I was the one he asked to escort her. He trusted me enough and I asked to escort her to the dance. And so he\u2019s the guy that was in charge and he\u2019s [ 00: 20: 00] sending people to [ Las] Vegas. I had a captain who was an idiot. I was in a unit that was going to Germany, and I wasn\u2019t going with them. So you wanted out of there. I wanted out of there, and so I called Colonel Powell and he said, What job do you want? And I said, Special Services sounds pretty good to me. In charge of a movie theater, bars, I mean this sounds good. And that\u2019s why I was a lieutenant and everybody else was\u2014 So you no longer wanted to be in that unit, you were hating the weather? Oh, yeah. Have you ever been to Fort Lewis? No. The saying is, \u201c If you can see Mt. Rainier, it\u2019s going to rain. If you can\u2019t see it, it\u2019s raining.\u201d And you were at attention more than three minutes and moss grew up the side of you. So I hated it. And I\u2019ve got sinuses anyhow. And so you wanted out, so the middle of the desert sounded like a good idea. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 11 The whole thing sounded like a great idea. And this is what he offered you. He gave you a choice of coming out to Nevada and being in charge of Special Services? That\u2019s right. So you\u2019re twenty- two and you come out to Nevada. I get in my car April 4, 1957. Memories\u2014 I looked these orders up, you know. Nineteen fifty- seven, I drove down the highway and I stopped at the Presidio [ San Francisco, California], which if you\u2019ve ever been to the Presidio, it\u2019s gorgeous. Sixth Army, get all my orders and everything straightened out, and I drove to Los Angeles, to Palos Verdes Estates where my cousin lived, visit them, and hit the highway from Los Angeles. I got here around April 11 or 12, I would think. That\u2019s basically what I remember. So what\u2019d you think of the [ Nevada] test site when you first saw it? Well, the first thing I see is Vegas. I stopped in Vegas. And I pulled up to the Sahara Hotel, which winds up coming in out of this whole year. And there was a movie at the time, Meet Me in Las Vegas or something, with Dan Dailey, the dancer, in it, and the first person I ever saw in Vegas was Dan Dailey coming out of the Sahara to get in a car. And I thought this was the glamour spot of the rest of the world after seeing this movie. And so then you get on the highway north and you make the turn at Indian Springs. It\u2019s a little different than the city. It\u2019s a little different. And you know all of a sudden we\u2019re in this land of\u2014 I mean I was familiar with the wooden barracks- type thing. When I was at Mizzou, you still had some of the World War II buildings, so I was familiar with that temp building. And you know we\u2019re up there. Younger officers were in a barracks. We didn\u2019t have a BOQ [ Bachelor Officers\u2019 Quarters] or a UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 12 private room. We were just in the barracks, and there was a parking lot outside the barracks that the coyotes used to run around in. You\u2019d have to chase them off when you went to get your car, you know, get out of here, get out, doggie. They didn\u2019t bother anything but they were out there and they\u2019d howl at night. It was really interesting. We were sort of on the, I want to think it would be north end of the camp. I\u2019m not sure, but I recall that you went in toward Mercury and you go to the left to Desert Rock, and then you hooked another right once you got in Desert Rock, which would mean that street was running north and south. So you were in there pretty far. Oh, we were in the back. Yeah, we were in the back. And the theater and the two\u2014 when you see the picture with the two\u2014 with the concrete pads, there are two big concrete pads, and the one on the side towards Vegas is going to be the mess hall, and the one on the other side is going to be the theater, which I was in charge of, so I know where it was. Yeah. And the mess hall, we let the cooks come to the show free and we ate in the middle of the night. Yeah. A little do- for- do, you know what I mean? That\u2019s why I know where both of them were. Did you know what the Nevada Test Site was prior to coming out? Were you familiar with it, and were you familiar with what was going on here? I\u2019m really trying to go back and I can\u2019t remember. Because it\u2019s still fairly new at this point. You talked to my wife yesterday and she said, knowing me, it was sort of the controlled danger type thing. That I tried to jump out of airplanes and I only weighed 118 pounds and you had to be 135 to pull the [ para] chute. So I needed something else to do whatever I wanted to prove my [ 00: 25: 00] manhood or whatever you want to call it. Still sort of a little cocky, swaggering. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 13 So talk about a little bit what your job was specifically with the test site, because it sounds like you did a variety of things but one of your main jobs was to coordinate the entertainment. I was in charge of the theater, the sports program. My office was in the library, which will be on the other side of the mess hall. It\u2019s right there. That was where we had the library for the troops, and we had a sports program. We had tours to\u2014 we didn\u2019t do much of that. We did that early and we didn\u2019t do that later on, because we had groups of people come in. But my main job was to be sort of the liaison between Vegas, and really more than Vegas, the entertainment group, the variety club. Are you familiar with the variety club? Yeah, but explain what it is in your\u2014 It was the charitable arm of the entertainment people. And part of their thing that they contributed was to entertain the troops who were at Camp Desert Rock. Now, you\u2019re in the Army, correct? I don\u2019t think we stated\u2014 Oh, yeah. Artillery. Field artillery. I wasn\u2019t a lawyer. Not yet. No, not even close. So you\u2019re now out at the test site and you\u2019re coordinating between the variety club, you\u2019re bringing entertainment out to Camp Desert Rock, yes? That was part of it. And my wife loves the story, the one sergeant who hated the captain as bad as I did and wanted to get out of Fort Lewis, I got him out of there, and the captain who was an idiot didn\u2019t know it, and he came and reported to me. He was my sponsor. He said, Lieutenant, Sergeant Little reporting for duty, and he started laughing and he said, Captain said, \u201c Where\u2019d you get these orders from? Do you know anything about it?\u201d And he said, You swore me to secrecy. And that was our captain. And he [ Little] was single. He was from L. A. He loved coming down. Anyhow he said, You ought to have UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 14 heard the names he called you, Lieutenant. There wasn\u2019t a thing he could do about it because you had the colonel\u2019s signature on it. Anyhow, so Bob Little and I used to drive in\u2014 Bob Little? That was the sergeant, yeah, and I used to drive in, and there were two \u2019 56 staff cars on post. Everything else was \u2019 52 because of the desert and everything. And we had one because we came into Vegas, and the general had the other. But both of them, if there was a general on post, I lost it because they had general\u2019s plates on them. And of course they were covered. And we used to pull in and we\u2019d come into Vegas and we\u2019d drive about the first sixty miles and I\u2019d sit in the front seat and we\u2019re talking, and then we\u2019d come into Vegas and I\u2019d get in the back seat, and we\u2019d wheel to mainly the Desert Inn or the Sahara, the two places we went, and he\u2019d wheel that car in there and pull it up, the general\u2019s plate cover was on there, and he\u2019d get out and he\u2019d go around to the back and snap that door open and salute, and everybody\u2019s waiting for some general or something and here was a second lieutenant. We used to laugh. We thought it was funny. We did it all the time. Really impressed people. But Bob was like a year older than I am. So you guys were having a ball doing that. Yeah. So what kinds of entertainment did you bring out there? We started the first few weeks, we had a stage out there, sound system. In fact, I think that one thing says I was building the\u2014 That\u2019s really interesting. I was in charge of it. I wasn\u2019t building it. I didn\u2019t know that there was a stage out there till I saw that. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 15 There was a stage out there and we had a sound system. We had dressing rooms for the people. I know we can\u2019t go out there because of the weather, but I could probably find it. Where was it, do you remember? It was back in that back part where we were, because that was where it was open where the parking lots were and everything. It was the north end. It was pretty well open. As I recall, it was over there. Anyhow, the first one we had was Jeanette MacDonald, who was a singer. Johnny Puleo, the little midget in Harmonica Gang? Yes, a bunch of little midgets played in Harmonica. I remember that. I don\u2019t know. I get a little lost on which one. Then we had Ming and I\u2019m going to law school. You know how it is. Things go on. Yeah, life just\u2014 Life goes on. And very nice. Very nice person. I think a great singer, although my wife says, I don\u2019t think she sings that well. But anyhow. So you brought entertainment out. Yes, and so those were shows that we did out there. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 17 OK. And you also took troops in to the city, correct? Then it got too hot. So your stage was outside. Yes. At the test site. Now we\u2019re getting into the end of June. Because I know she was there at the end of June, and I know her birthday\u2019s July 2, and one of the first times they came in was her birthday, I know that. My memory\u2019s not bad, is it? It\u2019s pretty good. Anyhow, so then we could no longer do that, and the hotels would give us on a Sunday afternoon the room. Which is? The showroom. And the soft drink companies of Las Vegas, we varied it, would donate two sodas per soldier we brought in. We couldn\u2019t have liquor because a lot of the people were under twenty- one. And we used to bring them in the buses because we had all the buses to go out to the desert, to go out to the site. And we used to bring them in, and then we\u2019d stage them coming back, so if somebody wanted to stay, you know\u2014 They could stay longer or leave earlier. Yeah, leave earlier or whatever they wanted to do. First show I remember was George Gobel, and what I remember was not George Gobel, it was the DeCastro Sisters singing \u201c Teach Me Tonight.\u201d I mean this for some reason stands out in my mind. We had Jack Benny, Gisele [ 00: 35: 00] McKenzie. My great moment in time, I was announcing when the buses were leaving and Jack Benny walked out on the stage, and I was a ham, and I crossed my arms and looked at UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 18 him and said, Well. You don\u2019t remember Jack Benny? That was his famous line. I couldn\u2019t resist. We had Carol Channing, which was what the Tropicana opened\u2014 it was the opening show. No, I think Eddie Fisher was the opening show, and she was the second show. So did you guys go to the Tropicana? Did you go to\u2014? Went to the Tropicana. We went to the Desert Inn, which was where Jack Benny was. We had Peter Lynn Hayes and Mary Healey, George Gobel. I\u2019m trying to think. We had a bunch of shows. I mean it was, I\u2019ll be very frank, I worked my butt off, because I was going out on shots, I was running the library, I\u2014 you know. Right. So you did a lot. I did a lot, yeah. So a couple questions. How often did you guys come into town for the shows? Oh, like every other week or so. OK. I\u2019m just curious how frequent that was. Things started to peter out out there, as far as above- ground testing, after Smoky, which is August 31 [ 1957]. September and October, one of the things, maybe I\u2019m wrong, you can look it up, I think most of those were underground. I mean you have a list, don\u2019t you? Well, they definitely started going underground in 1962. We went underground for a lot of those. But it probably started before then. The official moratorium came in \u2019 62 [ LTBT 1963]. In \u2019 62. But aren\u2019t we, in \u2019 57, the last actual\u2014 where they brought in troops and that? I know the military presence wasn\u2019t out there for that long a time. It was very early on. So that is something that we can look up. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 19 I think we may have been the last military presence. There may have been, I don\u2019t know. But I mean I\u2019m coming back here, I\u2019m working forty hours a week, going to night law school. I\u2019m not catching up on the news from Las Vegas, no. Well, OK, now, tell me about the other part of your job. You were out there for some of the shots. Yeah. Ones I can specifically recall by name: Hood, Priscilla, Diablo, Smoky, that by name go boom, boom, boom. I was out for more than that. OK, right, but those are the ones that stand out. Those are ones that I can tell you things that happened with them. So I\u2019m curious, here you are, you\u2019re twenty- two years old and you hadn\u2019t really been out to the desert before\u2014 Never left St. Louis before. And you\u2019re working for, at the time, the Nevada Test Site. It\u2019s a pretty, I don\u2019t want to say glamorous, but it\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019s a big deal. I don\u2019t know we looked at it that big a deal, I really don\u2019t\u2014 Well, that\u2019s my question. Did you realize what you were involved in? No. You want an honest answer? That\u2019s about as honest as I can get you, really. No, no, I don\u2019t think so. Right. Were you aware of the atomic testing that was going on? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, we were all\u2014 when we were oriented when we first came down here, we were aware of everything that was going on. What did they talk to you about? What did they tell you? How was your introduction to the site? Well, of course, in those days, they really didn\u2019t know what the heck was going on. We had a few courses. In fact, that article that I\u2019ve got is really backwards, because that was before I got UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 20 here that I was in the class with the guy from Hawaii who said\u2014 he was in Hiroshima. His family got caught in Japan in World War II. He lived through Hiroshima. He was in the Army with me. And that was before I was here. That was before you got here. Yeah. So I did know somebody who had been through\u2014 had a little bit of the thing. But we had no idea if the chain reaction was going to stop, or where it was going to stop. I mean, were we going to be part of it? We really didn\u2019t know. But you\u2019re twenty- two. You\u2019re not thinking of these things. You\u2019re Teflon. You\u2019re foolproof. Nobody can do anything to you at twenty- two, I don\u2019t think, can they? I don\u2019t think so. Well, now, I\u2019m just curious if you remember what that first experience was like when they told you you were going to be going out on a test. What was that like? What were some of the things you were thinking about? Well, you\u2019ve got to get us all into context. One of the stories I just thought of last night and I was [ 00: 40: 00] telling my wife was one of the guys was in G- 4, which was Services and all this kind of stuff. We had in the unit a doctor that was bitching about dust control, which you know the desert, the dust always\u2014 It\u2019s dusty. And when those clouds came over and dropped about three foot of water right into their camp, and him calling up and saying, Did you like our solution to your dust control? I mean, I remember that. So we were a little loosy- goosy. Anything. I\u2019m not sure if the first one I went out on was Hood. I want to think it was. You know Hood\u2019s the biggest one ever, blown up UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 21 [ largest atmospheric test at NTS, 74kt]. It was a balloon. I want to think it was. And I remember they had the pigs out there, where they were testing like sunscreen? The animal pigs. Yeah, animal pigs. Right. And I want to think that\u2019s the one where we got up out of the trenches and looked back and there was a rabbit who had been running across the desert who was frozen and fried in mid- air. We always figured, well, I guess if we had stuck our head out of the trench, we would\u2019ve been frozen in mid- air and fried, too. We learned it as we went along. Part of the reason we couldn\u2019t be too afraid was we were in charge. We had like thirty- five people. I was a second lieutenant but they may have been majors and colonels and everything. But I was in charge. They did what I said. And what did you do? What were you in charge of? OK, the afternoon before, we usually went out. We showed them where the trenches were. We showed them the tower. The soldiers. The other soldiers. Yeah, the ones we were training. We had our bus full, thirty- five people. And we basically explained to them all the safety precautions and what we expected them to do and what we were going to do. We had the shovel in case the trench came in. We told them if you get up and somebody\u2019s buried, you yell, we\u2019ll come. And basically taught them how to cover their eyes and turn and to protect themselves. And we had been out there, you know, trained to do that. And there was always a little ramp that went down in the trench. Then the trenches went out to the side. We were in that little ramp. We had to be the first ones out, and we counted. We counted to the blast, and when the blast went over, we knew the\u2014 because the speed of sound is where the UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 22 light\u2019s coming. No, excuse me, the speed of light\u2019s where the light\u2019s coming. The speed of sound to the blast. And so we knew when the blast went over, we could look at the cloud. So like lightning. When you see it go and you count? That\u2019s right. But we knew you could look up at the cloud by the time the blast went over. Right away, if you\u2019d looked at, you\u2019d have been blind. But we knew you could. So when we ran out of the thing, our first reaction was everybody up, everybody out! Look at the cloud! What did you think the first time you actually saw the cloud? You saw the blast happen and\u2014 I figured it was like you look at the big, tall building, it looks like it\u2019s falling on you, I thought, uh oh, it\u2019s coming back. We\u2019re going to get all that tower rained on us. And we used to joke about it. After a while, we used to joke about it. One day, it did it. They had to burn our uniforms. Take a shower. You know, I think, we took a shower, big deal, with the radiation. What shot was that, do you remember? I have no idea. I can\u2019t remember. I could give you a name but I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m not going to tell you something I don\u2019t know. Now, what\u2014 so many questions. I guess first of all I\u2019m curious as to what your reaction was. There are so few people in the world that have seen an actual atmospheric nuclear test, atomic test. You see in the pictures the enormous, brilliantly- colored clouds. Well, you could tell by how dark the color, from violet to purple, how dirty it was, because it was how much dirt went up in there. And, of course, the biggest thing that always fascinated me is you realize it\u2019s not a mushroom. It\u2019s a circle and the mushroom stem comes from the vacuum that\u2019s pulling up the dirt. And that\u2019s what gave it the dirt and the color. And we could tell how dirty you were\u2014 out by St. George, Utah and Enterprise and those babies were [ 00: 45: 00] going to get\u2014 by how dark it was. And we used to refer to it as a \u201c purple onion\u201d because it darkened UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 23 into a purple when the dust got up in there. It was really a little lighter than that when we first looked at it. Yeah. But as more dust went into it, the darker it got? Yeah. I\u2019m trying to think, my first reaction to it, I really\u2014 you know, you get sort of jaded because you went through it so many times. But were you nervous at all? What do you mean by \u201c nervous\u201d? I\u2019ve been a judge for thirty years. Every time I take the bench, I\u2019m nervous. But then. But it\u2019s a controlled nervousness, yeah. I think probably because I was responsible for these other people and everything, that my reaction was more to make sure they were all right\u2014 OK, so you\u2019re concentrating on the\u2014 \u2014 than to just sit there and, oh, isn\u2019t it pretty. I mean there was a little more\u2014 I think later on you maybe looked a little calmer at, hey, isn\u2019t that pretty. It was. It was beautiful. It was gorgeous. Awesome. Awesome! Did you realize the power of it? Oh, sure. Well, you just had that blast go. What do you think went over your head in that trench? You don\u2019t think it was quiet, do you? No. Tell me what it was like being in the trench when that happened. Well, I was a little bit claustrophobic. But I had the exit, didn\u2019t I, I guess. OK. Yeah, you were on the exit. I was on the exit, which was lucky. I don\u2019t know. I think the trench itself was just like any other hunk of ground out in the middle of the desert. It was dirty. A lot of it was sort of insecure. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 24 Unstable. You always check and make sure that you weren\u2019t in the place that might fall in when you\u2014. Did they ever fall in? Did they ever collapse? I never had it. But we used to carry trenching tools in case it did. That was our job. And you said they\u2019re what, about six feet deep? Well, I know exactly. They were six foot deep and they were two foot wide. And you had about three foot of space per person. I can tell you that, because there was always a thirty- five- man bus. I was number thirty- five, which meant there were seventeen on one side of me and seventeen on the other side. And those trenches were fifty foot long. You want to divide it up? It\u2019s going to come out three foot\u2014 Three feet a person. That\u2019s right. So what are the procedures? You said that you trained them in this. What types of procedures did you guys have? Well, we were also the last ones down. First ones out, last ones in. That\u2019s right. What was that, FIFO, first in, first out. I know that\u2019s not dealing with the trenches but that may give you the picture. So you went up and down that trench, and you had told them the day before that you kneel or bend. You had to be low because this stuff\u2019s flying over, and even the two- foot trench, some of it\u2019s going to hit the back of that trench. You know that, right? Yeah. And we had metal pots, metal helmets on. We had gas masks on. And other than that, you had on fatigues and there was no special clothing or anything. And basically you\u2019d get them out there. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 25 We had been out there the afternoon, we\u2019d put them in the trench, we\u2019d told them what to do, and then basically when I got them out there that night, right before\u2014 well, no, I probably wasn\u2019t in the trench till like fifteen seconds before. And you\u2019d make sure everybody was doing what you said, you know, and don\u2019t anybody dare get up till I tell you. And then you\u2019d go down and you\u2019d do your\u2014 what you were\u2014 Cover your eyes. Cover your eyes. Because all you had there was, of course, you had gas masks. You just had the small thing. No goggles, just the mask? No, when you\u2019re above ground you\u2019ve got goggles. OK, this is when we\u2019re in the trench. We\u2019ll talk about above ground later. But did you have them? No, you didn\u2019t have goggles because you were down and you were in the shade from the heat and the light. And you were the last one [ 00: 50: 00] down there. And I really think sort of, to a certain extent, you were so busy making sure, you know, because I mean above\u2014 one of those guys, gotten them blown away, I don\u2019t know what the heck would\u2019ve happened. We never had that, but I don\u2019t know. So you\u2019re concentrating on making sure everybody\u2019s OK. And I want to think Hood, but I don\u2019t remember. There were two big ones right in the beginning. One I was in the field for, and I want to think it was Hood. And the other one I was back, and all I remember, these were at 4: 30 in the morning, I was in the theater, I wasn\u2019t at the BOQ. I was in the theater, and the blast put a dent in the side of the theater. The theater was one of those old metal buildings. And one of the sides, and I thought, oh my God, is this thing going to come in? I remember that. And of course I was in the theater. I wasn\u2019t down or anything. I was what, fifteen, twenty miles away, I guess. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 26 That\u2019s pretty significant. Yeah, but it definitely dented, I remember. And I\u2019m confused as to\u2014 I want to think I was out for it. I want to think that was the famous rabbit that got killed across the back. It could\u2019ve been Hood I was back there. It could\u2019ve been another one early. But there was another big one early that\u2019s with it. Not Smoky or\u2014? No, Smoky was what, forty- four kilotons? No, Smoky was completely different. There was nobody in the trench for Smoky that I know of. I don\u2019t think there was anybody in there, because of what they were doing and what they were testing. You know, a lot of what they were testing now, as I said, they had the pigs out there. Yeah, tell me about that a little bit. See, you could defend yourself against the light and the heat\u2014 And that\u2019s what they used the pigs for, to see what would happen to them? Yeah. We probably had them for lunch at the mess\u2014 no, I don\u2019t think so. I shouldn\u2019t say a thing like that because they\u2019re not true. Well, you know, you hear stories. I\u2019ve heard about the pigs but I was just wondering what you remember about them and what they were used for. Well, I wasn\u2019t involved in that. You just remember being out there. I remember being out there, and they were using such stuff, like we used to talk about sunscreen, to see if that protected your skin. So they were putting stuff on the pigs to see if it would\u2014 UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 27 Yeah, see how you could protect a human being from the thing. You got to get this all in context. You got the light and the heat, number one, the speed of sound. The speed of light, excuse me. I keep on doing that. You had the blast, speed of sound, and third, you have radiation. So if you\u2019re defending yourself, you go shade\u2014 So you don\u2019t want to look at the light. You don\u2019t want to be by the light. Well, you don\u2019t want the light to burn you either. Not like the sun, my God, you know, it\u2019s hot. And I mean you could feel that in the trench, by the way. You could feel the heat. You could feel the heat, even though you were under. Yeah, I mean it probably\u2014 you think it\u2019s hot out, what is it? Probably out there right now it\u2019s 126. Of course, we\u2019re 4: 30 in the morning, which meant it was about 55. It probably went up to 126. Yeah. But it was hot. It was hot. You could feel it. You could definitely feel it. But no, and when you covered, you could see your bones. It X- rayed and you definitely could see your hands, or a lot of times you would have your elbow up, you know, over your eyes, and you could see those\u2014 I know what those bones in there look like. They weren\u2019t broke so. But anyhow, you could see those. But first reaction. Impressed, yeah. Scared, never. Never. I really can\u2019t say I was ever afraid. I think you have the momentary thing right before it goes off where I hope the chain reaction stops. I hope these idiots know what they\u2019re talking about. But true fear fear, no, no, no. No, I can\u2019t say that. There was probably that momentary\u2014 which I think in my letter you get a little bit of that, not really from me but from somebody else\u2019s\u2014[ see Robert Curran letter of July 1957 regarding witnessing 17 kt atmospheric atomic detonation, Diablo, from trench at NTS] Well, I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s just that, like you were saying, that moment of just we really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 28 And we\u2019re here and there\u2019s no way to get out because if you were to decide you were going to run, that baby\u2019s going to catch up with you. So it\u2019s better to stay in the trenches. So you mentioned being out in the field, too. [ 00: 55: 00] What was that like? What do you mean, what\u2014? I\u2019m sorry, I don\ufffd\ufffdt\u2014 Well, as opposed to being in the trenches. I mean\u2014 Oh, that was\u2014 you were ten miles back. So you weren\u2019t nearly as close. They had those. In fact, they got a really good thing at the [ Atomic Testing] museum where they have these benches, and they were there. They were there. And that\u2019s where we were. Now, when I was there, I had Canadians, on Smoky. Smoky\u2019s famous, you know that, don\u2019t you? Yeah. It was the dirtiest one in history, and we\u2019re not going to talk why it was dirtiest one in history, but it was the dirtiest one in history, and I had a bus full of Canadians. Soldiers? Queen\u2019s Own Rifles, which were sort of like our Special Forces. These guys didn\u2019t have summer uniforms. They double- timed everyplace in winter uniforms. They were the toughest human beings I have ever known. Two paratroopers in the NCO [ Noncommissioned Officers\u2019] Club one night decided to pick on one of those guys. Called him a pansy or something because he had to wear a uniform a lot, and they took a punch at him and they both wound up in the hospital. These were the toughest human beings I have ever seen. But you\u2019d go over\u2014 I remember there was a guard at the bank in Vegas where we took the money for the theater who was Canadian. And he asked me to go out and talk to the Canadians about coming in and he had a barbeque for them at UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 29 his house and that. And so you\u2019d go over to where the Canadians were, and I want to think it was a colonel, a lieutenant colonel, and you\u2019d walk in and a sergeant would greet you, and I mean they would right away, if you wanted a gin- and- tonic, you can have it. I never did. My father was an alcoholic. I\u2019ve had a few drinks in my life but I don\u2019t even drink anymore. That\u2019s nothing with me or anything, it\u2019s just I don\u2019t. But anyhow, they would offer you iced tea or whatever, you know, and before you went in to see the colonel, they sat that down and you talked to him. Great people. Really great. Very polite. Wonderful. And the weather was terrible, coming up to Smoky. I mean it was bad. Was it just raining or windy or\u2014? A little bit of everything. Well, the monsoon, you\u2019re talking late August, right, I mean\u2014 Yeah, and you think the desert, people don\u2019t realize\u2014 You\u2019ve lived in the desert long enough to realize that in late August or around in there, you get bad weather. So we\u2019re talking August 31 is when the shot\u2014 it was supposed to run from like about the 25th. So we\u2019d come into town sometime in the evening, and I can\u2019t remember where AEC [ Atomic Energy Commission] headquarters was. Downtown. And it had a light on there. And we\u2019d sneak out and look at the light. And if it was red, we just stayed in town and partied. And that night I recall it going green and we said, we\u2019d better go. It was my birthday August 31, so what were we doing in town on Friday night? We were celebrating my birthday, right? And I remember flying that highway out there to get there. We did. We got there in time. I was driving. That highway was [ makes a sound indicating the highway was clear]. And I was sober. But it was still\u2014 UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 30 Oh, it\u2019s still a good hour\u2019s drive. We did it in about fifty- two minutes or something. I was going 106, I remember. Anyhow, but you know how flying it was. But anyhow, we got out there and walked on the bus about 12: 30, my twenty- third birthday, and the Canadians break out with \u201c Happy Birthday, Leftenant.\u201d And then they were all kidding me about, You wanted this big birthday candle for your birthday, didn\u2019t you? You\u2019re the reason we\u2019ve been here all week, you know, and all this kind of stuff. That I remember vividly. And then we go out. We\u2019re back now. We\u2019re above ground. Now, we\u2019ve got the glasses. Even with glasses, you\u2019re still not supposed to look directly at the blast. But again, I\u2019m the one that\u2019s got to tell them when to take off the glasses because if you got the glasses on, you can\u2019t see the cloud. And so now we\u2019re ten miles back. We\u2019re not talking eight, ten seconds from [ 01: 00: 00] blast anymore, are we? We\u2019re talking forty- five, fifty seconds, something like that. And you told them to watch the road because the blast is going to kick up the dirt. And of course, about half of them listen to you. And when the blast hit, about half of them wound up flat on their butts because the blast hit them and knocked them down. Shock wave? Yeah, the shock wave, whatever word. See, I use different terminology sometimes. See, we\u2019ve now sophisticated some of this. We just said \u201c the blast.\u201d But when it hit them, you know. But I remember we were standing back there, what you had to do is get down and sort of turn your head because you had the helmet on. Because the missiling, you know, the major deaths in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, everything else, was missiling, where the blast takes and throws things and turns them into bullets or some kind\u2014 Debris. Flying objects. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 31 That\u2019s the main cause of death in Hiroshima, and that\u2019s what you had to be careful of. And we knew that. But anyhow, when it went up, that baby was purple. We knew it was dirty. We knew it was dirty. And the reason for it is they backed it into a hill. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll even admit this today, but they backed it into a hill because when you have a blast, you create a vacuum. We\u2019ve already talked about the stem of the mushroom. OK, so when it bounces off the ground, the face is round, and when the beginning edge of the shock wave, or blast, bounces off the ground, it bounces back up into the vacuum, right? And then it comes out\u2014 I\u2019m trying to think of how to express it properly. It comes out and it catches up with the one that\u2019s against the atmosphere. Because it\u2019s in a vacuum, right? It catches up with it and presents what they call a mach- Y stem which intensifies the blast. Because you have two blasts\u2014 Right. It\u2019s double the\u2014 OK, the reason they backed it up in the hill was that they wanted to create what they called a triple mach- Y stem, not only when it bounces off the ground but when it bounced off the hill, it came and intensified that shock wave. That\u2019s why it\u2019s backed up against the hill. What did it do? It got in part of that hill. What causes it to be dirty? The dirt that\u2019s radiation and takes everything out. And that\u2019s why that was the one that was so famous and that\u2019s the one where people died of leukemia. That\u2019s the one where they contacted people like me from CDC, Centers for Disease Control\u2014 Now, I just want to stop for one second. I need to pause to make a CD identification, and then just go on. [ 01: 03: 20] End Track 2, Disc 1. [ 00: 00: 00] Begin Track 2, Disc 2. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 32 OK. So speaking of dirty blasts, now is this something that you ever thought about when you were out there? Did they ever talk to you about it? I don\u2019t remember. We knew how to defend ourselves. And I remember they had shot one in Frenchman\u2019s Flat. We were at Yucca. I don\u2019t think we had anything in Frenchman\u2019s. They had used up Frenchman\u2019s earlier where they had fired one underground and they had a robot that they sent down underneath there and took pictures of the interior, and of course what causes jewelry, what causes gems? Heat and pressure. So what do you have underneath that ground? Heat and pressure. What do you have covering the walls of where that came? Gems. Why can\u2019t you go down and mine them? Because I give my wife that diamond and I kill her in about a half an hour. It\u2019s all radioactive down in there. I\u2019m sure that they can take you out here right now and show you some of those caverns because they have robots that they can send in there where those things were and they will be gorgeous, beautiful. Well, diamonds, emeralds, rubies, whatever the composition of the soil was that they heated and pressurized. But you can\u2019t get to them. You can\u2019t use them. No way. So where was I at? You got me lost. No, I got me lost. Well, I was just curious if you ever thought to yourself, wow, this may not be so good, or there\u2019s a possibility of contamination, or if they ever mentioned it, or if it just wasn\u2019t even an issue. I don\u2019t remember. I really don\u2019t. In fact, everybody asks me, have you ever had any aftereffects? And for years, if I went swimming and didn\u2019t put on a T- shirt, I\u2019d get a rash on my back. One doctor one day said, Where were you exposed to radiation? He said, You have radiation burns on your back. Did you know that? And it only comes out if I\u2019m in the sun. If I have this shirt on like I do today, it\u2019s not going to come out, but if I\u2019m in the sun, it\u2019s UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 33 coming out. It\u2019s going to come out. Do I have some memorabilia from the fact that it was radiation? Yeah. Did I get that the day the tower backed up? Yeah, what happened with that? Well, we\u2019re joking as we always were about the cloud backing up on us, right? And all of a sudden, you hear this stuff on your steel pot going tink, tink. So the tower, basically after the shot goes off, disintegrates. The tower wasn\u2019t steel. I\u2019m trying to think, what was the stuff we had in chemistry? My wife told me last night, and I can\u2019t remember, that burned real quickly, because they wanted something that dissolved. Because it goes with the blast. It just dissolves with the blast. Yeah. I remember walking out after the blast was over, this is how casual we were, to ground zero within an hour or two of the blast, and standing on the concrete pad with the parts of the tower that showed you the curvature of the blast, but it didn\u2019t quite hit the ground because they didn\u2019t want it to hit the ground. Those towers were basically 500 foot high. I don\u2019t want to get too scientific, but a 20- kiloton blast will not cover 500 feet, and that\u2019s why they were that high. We had one or two balloons, but most of them were towers. And I\u2019ll think of the name of that metal, but they weren\u2019t really steel. They were\u2014 I don\u2019t remember. I\u2019ll think of it. I\u2019ll have you call one of these people over at the Chemistry Department and they\u2019ll tell you what it was. But yeah, you got the little dings. And then on the way back in, because we came through Mercury. We went back to the highway and up from Mercury to go out because the road went out from Mercury, even though we were further in. And I think we stopped in Mercury and they gave us new uniforms. And had to shower off? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 34 In fact, I think this is part of the reason, the letter I wrote from the trenches in pencil? The reason [ 00: 05: 00] for that, we didn\u2019t have our wallets with us, we didn\u2019t have\u2014 I couldn\u2019t have had a watch on, I couldn\u2019t have had a ring on, because if we had come back that time, we would\u2019ve lost all that. See, we used to lock them up before we went out. So you couldn\u2019t wear anything out there. And that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t have a pen. I had a pencil. Sure, that makes sense. But they took our uniforms. We all had a little badge- like thing which you can see over at the [ museum], and I know somebody that has one. A little badge- like thing [ dosimeter] that you put the film thing in there, and they measured the radiation by how much the film developed, and if you got a certain level of radiation, you went home. I never got there, obviously. Now, they have your radiation records? Do you have\u2014? I have no idea. All I know is in St. Louis, where I\u2019m from, they had a big records center fire back a few years ago, and the records that were destroyed were from 1912 to 1960. And I know some of mine were in there because they\u2019ve asked me for orders and stuff. You know, when the CDC, they wanted orders, too, I could tell them who was there and things like that. So are they gone? I don\u2019t know. But that would have to be the records center, and I really have never\u2014 what I have, you\u2019ve seen a lot. I have some other ones that just say \u201c orders\u201d and I was doing this or I was doing that, but I didn\u2019t think they affected what you particularly wanted. So as far as you know, your radiation level is minimal? You\u2019ve got no adverse effects other than some radiation exposure on your back? Never. And I\u2019ve been checked a couple of times. My cholesterol is only 54. Maybe it radiated that. I don\u2019t know. Maybe that\u2019s a good thing. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 35 Do you think that there was exposure out there? Oh, yeah! I know there were! Why did people die? A lot of leukemia out of there. Well, I mean there\u2019s a lot of people that say no, that\u2019s impossible, it couldn\u2019t have happened out there. If you were that close? Yeah. I would think that probably St. George, Utah got more than we did. We got backed- up on one time; St. George, Utah, or Enterprise, whichever one you want, the sheep ranch, you\u2019re familiar with the sheep ranch in between there and Utah. They lost a lot of sheep out there. The old joke is, a friend of mine is a lawyer who was a pilot. And he used to fly through the clouds. And he was at Bikini. Flew through the clouds. And the joke was, when he was in my courtroom, that if the lights went out, nobody would know the difference because we both glowed. We didn\u2019t, of course, but I mean that was always the joke, if Greg O\u2019Shea and myself were in the room together, that the whole thing would glow. He would have had nothing to do with this. He was on the big ones. Right, over in the Pacific. The Pacific. He was a pilot and he flew right through the clouds, picked up samples. Those were big, though. Those were some of probably biggest ones. Oh, those were megatons. We\u2019re talking kilotons. They were megatons. Yeah. Those guys had more than we did. Now, I don\u2019t really know how to phrase this. Did you have any opinion on nuclear testing when you were out there? Now, obviously, it grew into this very subversive issue, but you were out there pretty early on in the beginning of the program. No. I went to the museum and they wanted to talk about we were the heroes of the Cold War. There was an article in the New York Times that somebody sent me that said, we were the heroes UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 36 because we were the sacrificial\u2014 we\u2019re the guinea pigs of the era. I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t feel that way. I was out there, I was doing a job. I\u2019m not altruistic about it, but I\u2019m also not [ a] condemnation person about it. It was something we did. And if you read some of my stuff like when I wrote when I was a kid, it was not completely \u201c my country, right or wrong.\u201d It was close to it. We\u2019re coming out of the Second World War. We still have that gung- ho. Even when [ 00: 10: 00] you take Korea, there was still that we- were- defending- the- world- for- democracy- type of\u2014 that\u2019s World War I, that\u2019s Wilsonian. But you know, there was still this\u2014 you sort of did what you did. I know guys who were in World War II, fought in these big battles and things like that. I never did anything like that. That was what you did. And I got this thing that I want to check on, the colonel that wrote the letter of commendation on me, and he\u2019s known as Standing- Dan- the- Ring- Mountain Man, and the way I gather it, in Korea he was commander of the Seventh Cav[ alry]. Do you know anything about the Korean War? A little bit. OK, the North Koreans attacked South Korea. That much I know. American forces from Japan rush into Pusan and establish what\u2019s known as the Pusan Perimeter. This was the Seventh Cav. They were completely outmanned; I mean this was, hey, get over there. It\u2019s June 2, get over there February the\u2014 two weeks, they get them up from Japan and send them over. And they broke out of the Pusan Perimeter. And I want to think that\u2019s where the Dan- the- Ring- Mountain Man, the way I understand, he got in the Ring Mountain with a Jeep and said, Follow me, men. And they broke out of there. About the same time, [ General Douglas] MacArthur\u2019s coming over the Inchon [ River] on the other side of the peninsula and they put the pincers on the Koreans and they drove them all the way up to the 38th Parallel. The question is, UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 37 do we go into China? And about that time, China comes in and pushes us back to the 38th Parallel, and then we have the armistice. That is a simplified, very quick, one- minute description of the Korean War. Now, go read the book and you\u2019ll learn a lot more. So I want to think that that\u2019s where that was. I know he was a hero in the Korean War. I know he was Eisenhower\u2019s\u2014 he was the guy that wrote the orders for D- Day. He was SHAEF, Strategic Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, which is Normandy. And he was the guy that wrote the orders. Eisenhower gave them; he wrote them. Somebody\u2019s got to do it. It\u2019s a good team. Well, if you look in those letters, he keeps on saying, If you\u2019re coming to Washington\u2014. I saw that. You know what he was talking about introducing me to, don\u2019t you? Who was the president? Get you a good job. I was busy going to law school. Now, maybe I should\u2019ve. I could\u2019ve become a big Republican and become a neo- conservative or something and been\u2014 no, I\u2019m just joking. I say that. But you know, I do respect Eisenhowerbecause he\u2019s the guy that said beware of the military- industrial complex, and I do respect\u2014 Yes. He had some good foresight. He had some good foresight. And he was a good man, but he was not\u2014 and got pushed around a little bit by the military- industrial complex. That\u2019s why beware. Yeah, beware. So, go ahead. I\u2019m sorry I got you strung off on something else. No, that\u2019s fine. No, it\u2019s all part of the story. So you\u2019re out there through October, you say? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 38 Yeah, beginning of October. I don\u2019t remember the exact date. I know it was football season. I got up at six. I left here at one o\u2019clock in the afternoon. I wanted to get back to Columbia [ Missouri] for a football game on Saturday. And I drove from here nonstop to Dodge City, Kansas, which is 1,200 miles, twenty- four hours. In those days, 50 miles an hour was going. Twenty- four hours flat. I stopped about one or two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, went to bed, got up at midnight, drove to Columbia, and went to the football game that afternoon. You had a goal. I was twenty- three years old. I had a goal. But I remember getting to Columbia about three in the morning, and then going to the football game, and then driving home. Now, did you choose to leave? Were you just done? Was your time at the test site only like\u2014? If you look at it, [ Operation] Plumbbob was over. OK. So you were just out there for Plumbbob. Yes. We closed everything up. I\u2019m sure if you look at the records, everything\u2019s going to be closed up about that time. I don\u2019t think I was the last guy out but, you know. I\u2019m sure there [ 00: 15: 00] were other guys. I mean the theater was not the end- all of what they were\u2014 I\u2019m sure there was other equipment people. You had also asked me about the racial makeup. Yeah. Yeah. Basically we had a black transportation unit. That\u2019s why we gave them \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd 52 Chevrolets rather than\u2014 now, it\u2019s not nice to say, but you know. But yes, we had the \u2019 52 Chevrolets because we were in the middle of the desert. But they drove all the trucks. They drove the buses, you know. I had one sergeant of mine was a black guy who had been a RIF- ed major. Reduction in force. Remember, we\u2019re right after Korea. So they had all these guys who were permanent- ranked UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 39 sergeants who then were upped to officers because they had to beef up the Army to go in Korea, and here they are, they\u2019re reduced back. What do you do? Yeah. Yeah, and these two guys\u2014 one guy was white, one guy was black\u2014 were majors, and they had been at Fort Ord, Camp Ord, in California, and they wanted to get them out of there, and then they had the option whether they wanted to stay in the military as a sergeant and be transferred elsewhere. But they had to have a safe place to put them. So, I\u2019ll be very frank, I was a little shavetail second lieutenant. They were majors. As far as I was concerned, these guys knew more about the Army than I did. I just left them alone. That\u2019s why I probably don\u2019t remember their names. I remember Bob Little\u2019s name, because he was with me from the beginning. And I remember Franklin Delano Farley\u2019s [ sp] name, who was a private who couldn\u2019t get in the Army now because he was borderline retarded. And I was on every board, and they were going to 208 Farley out of the service, unfit. And there was somebody that was in his command that didn\u2019t understand. And I remember, I was on the board and I said, Give him to me. He\u2019s only got like three or four months to go. I\u2019ll have him sweep up the theater. I\u2019ll give him things he can do. And I remember Bob Little and myself, we got him through, taking him down to the bus terminal and sending him back to Minnesota with written instructions where he changed the bus. And we got him out. And we got him an honorable discharge. And he was very loyal. Because one day some guys from Fort Lewis come down and were standing in front of the theater and somebody comes up, and these are young guys joking, looks at me and said, Hey, you rotten son- of- a\u2014 you know. And Farley was going to take him on because he called me a son- of- a- bitch. We didn\u2019t mean anything or, you know, nobody was excited, but Farley was\u2014 I mean he was borderline. He didn\u2019t understand it. We had a dog UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 40 that we had picked up in the desert called Flicker, who lived in the theater. Flicker. Flick. Lived in the theater. And Farley took care of the dog. He slept in the theater. He swept the theater. He swept my office. Once a week on a Saturday when there was no traffic, we allowed him to drive my Jeep down to pick up the mail, which was the highlight of Farley\u2019s week. And he thought I was a genius because I knew he was born in 1936, because his name was Franklin Delano and it would\u2019ve been an election year, presidential candidate, and he said, How did you know that, Lieutenant? Like, you know, I was some kind of a brilliant\u2014[ and I said], Well, pretty obvious, Farley. But you know. But I mean my floor in my theater or my floor in my office sparkled. Because he knew enough to know we saved him. Know we saved him. You want to know about suicide? One suicide while we were out there, a captain, Finance. We talked about RIF. This wasn\u2019t\u2014 and I was on that board. I wound up in all that. Now that I think about that, they worked my butt off out there. And we looked at the finances. Everything was\u2014 his family, his wife and family were all intact. The only thing we could ever find, it\u2019s the day before he committed suicide, he had gotten a RIF notice. He was going back. And that Wednesday afternoon was R& R, rest and recreation. And we used to play bridge at the [ 00: 20: 00] Officers\u2019 Club, and one of the guys was a doctor, and he was in the group, and he was talking to the doctor about if you get shot in the head, you know, and how bad it\u2019d feel. The doctor said no, the way you could go right away is if the bullet goes right through your heart. And the next morning, Thursday morning\u2014 he was right. I heard the shot. I recall it. He\u2019d unbuttoned his shirt and he pulled it up, put his .45 in there, and put himself away. And we investigated it. We had one court- martial. A guy who stole the laundry money and went to Vegas. Got caught and he charged him and then they put him back in charge of the laundry money, and UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 41 guess what he did? He went AWOL [ absent without official leave]. So you used to have an officer that when he was\u2014 well, he was at Fort Ord, too, which he was going to go back for his court- martial at Fort Ord. And I was in charge of protecting his rights while we had him. That was me. And so he went back to Fort Ord, and in those days you could request any officer in the military to come defend you. So I get this thing, we\u2019re flying you over to Fort Ord to defend this guy. Flew into San Francisco to defend this guy in a court- martial. And I get over there and he said, Hi, Lieutenant, I want to plead guilty. I said, What the hell? You got me all the way over here. And he said, Well, you did a good job and I thought you needed a little vacation. So I wind up over there, and he\u2019s got two charges, a theft and an AWOL, which would\u2019ve been ten- and- a- half years and a dishonorable discharge. And I think I did my job because he got six months and a bad conduct discharge. And then I told him how, after he got out of the Army, to have the bad conduct discharge changed into a general discharge. But he was a hero in Korea. That was my theory. Well, first thing, I got the whole second part knocked out because I said, Who was the idiot that put him back in charge of the money? Starting your law training then, too. Yeah, that\u2019s the first case I ever defended. Pled him guilty. But everybody knew. I wasn\u2019t a lawyer, but everybody\u2014 You were just headed that way. Everybody knew what I was wanting to do. And so I wound up on all these stupid boards. Well, it sounds like you had a full\u2014 you were 110 percent involved. Oh, yeah, when I think of it, well, that one letter that I sent to my mother, not the one from the trench, the other one, it says, This is the first weekend I\u2019ve had off in, you know, UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 42 because I was doing things on the weekend. Let\u2019s be honest, I don\u2019t tell my mother everything because what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. I didn\u2019t tell her about drinking at the Sahara or anything of that nature, yeah. But basically, yes, you figure what I was doing. I mean in the evenings, what was going on? The theater. And the story of the theater I remember is we got the musical Oklahoma!, which I thought, oh great. They booed because they thought it was going to be a Western, and when he starts singing\u2014 Oh, no! That\u2019s right. That\u2019s funny. The troops didn\u2019t like it. I remember that because I sort of wondered what I had. I\u2019ve had this college class on the history of musical comedy. I got Oklahoma! But I wasn\u2019t the one they were playing it for. So I remember that vividly. These guys, they wanted their money back. [ They said], We didn\u2019t come to hear that gal sing. We wanted to see some gunfights. Yeah, so much for the musical. That\u2019s right. Which, of course, was, as we discussed yesterday, part of the reason. They wanted to see some gunfighting because we were out here in Nevada. Well, yeah, there\u2019s a whole attitude. Whole attitude. And a whole reputation. But I didn\u2019t. You gathered if I wanted the other thing, that I didn\u2019t really 100 percent have that attitude. I\u2019m the world\u2019s worst shot. I was in the Army and I never\u2014 the only reason I got a marksmanship medal is my Jeep driver pulled the target for me. He said, We take care of you, Lieutenant? I can\u2019t shoot and I still can\u2019t shoot worth a darn. But I have a [ 00: 25: 00] marksmanship medal. Joe Lapinski, my driver, took care of that at Fort Lewis. Well, it\u2019s good you\u2019ve never had to enter a competition or something. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 43 Well, I thank God I never had to\u2014 I don\u2019t know if I could kill anybody or not. I really don\u2019t. I have no idea. I don\u2019t think you know till you get there. I would think when my girls were small, to protect them, I\u2019d probably do it. But personally, could I? Probably not. I\u2019m the lawyer that got the death penalty, and the reason I got death penalty in a trial is because I didn\u2019t believe in it, and when I went to the jury I said, Here are your options. You can either give him life imprisonment or death, and I\u2019m not going to tell you which one to do. And they gave him death, and the only reason the guy wasn\u2019t killed was that was before the Supreme Court overturned it. And I was so happy when the guy wound up with life imprisonment because I was worried I was going to have to go to Jeff[ erson] City and watch the guy die. I really didn\u2019t want to do that. But could I try the case and get it? Yes. My job. Could I go with the bomb and do it? Yes. If I was embarking it, yes. That make sense? It does. I mean because you mentioned sort of a dichotomous resistance before. The ultimate dichotomy, yeah. Yeah. And I mean you seem to be a very gentle kind of person with a good, nonviolent attitude, yet\u2014 I think the two most important phrases in the English language are \u201c please\u201d and \u201c thank you.\u201d But yet, here you are out at the Nevada Test Site with the atomic bomb, which is possibly the most awesomely, staggeringly powerful\u2014 Remember my telling you, that\u2019s why you get it in context? Yeah. I mean that had to be very interesting for you. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 44 You know, and really as time went by, until I got back out here in February, this sort of fades into being a judge for thirty years and raising a family, all the things that have been important to me. Well, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s some, a part of your\u2014 You know I had to dig to find those things, don\u2019t you? They weren\u2019t just right there. They are now because I found them, yeah. Right. So that\u2019s interesting, revisiting that whole aspect, that whole era, I bet. Yeah. The era is a dichotomy. I talk about the era as a dichotomy. I said to you yesterday, so many things that we see today, the George Wilson saying what\u2019s good for General Motors is good for the country, the ultimate\u2014 if it\u2019s business and profit, it\u2019s the ultimate. OK. The realization of Eisenhower about the military- industrial complex. The running against Stevenson on the anti- intellectual. The Joe McCarthy. This comes in my time. Rock and roll comes in my time. Brown vs. the School Board [ Brown vs. Board of Education]. I start college in \u2019 52, Mizzou, not one black student. I graduated \u2019 56. Fifty- four is Brown\u2014 eleven out of 7,700. We really improved! OK? But hey, black people didn\u2019t go to school in those days. They were working for my dad\u2019s union. When I go back and I think when I was a little kid, my dad used to take me with him up in North St. Louis and we\u2019d go\u2014 I know, I\u2019m a great expert on barbeque because we\u2019d be taking checks like to\u2014 in black neighborhoods, which were completely safe, I\u2019m sorry, in those days, completely safe. And you\u2019d go into the alleys and these people would be selling barbeque out of their garages. So somebody says, You really know barbeque! I was a little kid. I was exposed to these things. I guess I was just\u2014 oh, my wife always says that\u2014 when I was a prosecutor, we had a sixteen- year- old girl that did not know what her father did for a living. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 45 Now, you remember, I\u2019m a prosecutor in \u2019 77 and \u2019 75, so my oldest daughter is five. All [ 00: 30: 00] right. And I always made up my mind when I grew up\u2014 Sixty- seven to seventy- five? Well, I was actually a prosecutor from \u2019 65 to \u2019 75, but they had a prosecutor \u2019 73, \u2019 74, \u2019 75. I was assistant before then. And I said my girls will always know what I do. Of course, I was in the paper a lot, too. And I used to take my kids out to the courtroom. I used to always joke. I said they were like the lawyers. They had their Crayons and sat at the counsel table. And my oldest daughter, when she was in kindergarten, they had J- words. You know, you had A- words and B- words and J- words, and she put a bunch of bars and she put a guy in black in back of a desk. And a teacher said, Kasey Curran, what are your J- words? And she said, Judge and jail. And the teacher said, Why? And she said, My daddy\u2019s a judge and he sends people to jail. And the teacher said, What does a judge do? She\u2019s five. And she looked at her and she said, When people can\u2019t make up their minds, they come to him and he makes up their minds for them. That is a good answer. I remember that to this day because that\u2019s what I do. The five- year- old was right. But you knew she had some insight or whatever for doing it. And I\u2019ve always believed that because, you know, they needed to know who I was and who they were and where they were coming from. Now, did you ever talk to them about your days out in the test site? I doubt it. I mean I probably mentioned it, but as I said, when this all came up, most of this stuff was buried. I had to dig to find\u2014 I had to go through boxes to find some of this stuff. And of course my big find was the letter. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 46 Yes, well, that\u2019s a great find. It was a great find, and as a history major I think that\u2019s a great find. And somehow I\u2019m going to make sure it winds up over at this\u2014 Oh, they could definitely use a copy. I think that when they\u2019re talking about the soldiers out there, that is it. Well, that\u2019s the ultimate first- hand experience. That\u2019s it. This old man remembers what happened forty- eight years ago. That young kid was right there. I always come with these little conclusions, don\u2019t I? You can tell I\u2019m a speaker. The young kid lived it and he knew it. There\u2019s no history or glamorization, although it is pretty definitive. And at the time I think it was pretty glamorous. Well, my wife said, You wrote better then than you do now. Well, you\u2019re in the moment, too, you know, a lot of stuff going on. Yeah. But you read some of my stuff I did write\u2014 Well, you\u2019re a very good writer. At that time. Well, my sister\u2019s an English teacher and my brother was the chief technical writer for Martin Marietta Corporation. My wife was a business and English teacher. My daughters are a book editor, a lawyer, and paralegal. Do you want to play Wheel of Fortune in our house? It\u2019s like vicious. First one that knows the answer just yells it out and ruins it for everybody else. We call it Full Contact Wheel of Fortune. My middle daughter makes us all look bad. You put up two letters and she says, you know. I think I\u2019m getting real good. So you\u2019ve had some practice. Yeah. Ah, go to hell. But yeah. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 47 So what did your family think about you being out at the test site, your mom, your dad, your sister\u2014? Well, you can tell [ by] the tenor of the letters that they were worried. They were scared. They were worried. Because I\u2019m trying to tell them in the one letter, that part of it which was the trench part is over. We\u2019re going to be fifteen (we weren\u2019t fifteen, we were about ten miles) but we\u2019re going to be fifteen miles back, so there\u2019s nothing to worry about. And, you know, that\u2019s a little bravado. Sure. And you don\u2019t want them to worry. Yeah, you don\u2019t want them to worry. But the little bravado is to make them not worry. Yeah, but [ 00: 35: 00] like, hey, I\u2019m fifteen miles back, no big deal. But if you read the letter, this was\u2014 because I\u2019ve read all this stuff trying to say, where was I? What was I doing? I was in a hurry, if you read from that letter, to get out of the Army because I wanted to go to law school. That\u2019s what you were saying. I\u2019m one of the few people that you know that at age five wanted to be like a lawyer, and did it, and at age seventy- one still loves it and still cares about it. It\u2019s great. You have a passion. So as soon as you got out of the military\u2014 well, you were in the military for a while, but after you left the test site is when you went back to law school. No. I go to Fort Lewis from October till the next April. And I get back up to the Fourth Infantry Division and the colonel says, Oh, I see you\u2019re a Special Forces lieutenant. We want to beat the Twelfth Infantry Division, which I referred to, too, being down there, in some sport. Would you take over as the athletics and recreation officer for the Fourth Infantry Division and see if you can do that? And he said, You\u2019ve got all the backing I [ you] want. So I did that, and I boxed. I got to the UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 48 finals of the Sixth Army tournament, 112- pound class. Hey. Got knocked out in that. But I got that far. I got that far. So I found a sergeant who was a professional boxer and we trained the boxing team and we beat the Twelfth Infantry. It all came down to basketball. The Twelfth Infantry had a guy by the name of Roger Byrd who was an All- American out of Kentucky, and another All- American out of the University of San Francisco, who was a black guy, by the way. The other guy was a white guy. He was a black guy. It only becomes important later when I tell you who he was. Yeah, he was coaching that team and I was coaching our team. And we had a guy by the name of Bruce Palmer who was a lieutenant and became one of the first black generals in the Army. And Bruce was a great basketball player. He was about six- three. But he wouldn\u2019t play because he was\u2014 we got him to play one game. We beat the Twelfth, I think it was 45- 42, and Bruce had forty- three points. He played in one game. The next time I coached a team, it was my daughter\u2019s eighth- grade Sacred Heart team. The next time the other guy coached a team, it was the Boston Celtics, because his name was K. C. Jones, The K. C. Jones, All- American, nice guy, really nice guy. But I beat him and then I got the eighth- grade team and he got the pro team. Yeah. But it couldn\u2019t have had anything to do with\u2014 my coaching was give the ball to Bruce. Yeah. Well, you know, if you got a strategy that works, go with it. It worked. But anyhow, the colonel was thrilled to death. They beat the Twelfth Infantry. And then April, I\u2014 actually, it wasn\u2019t quite two years, I got out early because I wanted to get back and file for state representative, which I did, and I got beat. You know, because my dad was dead and I was not, I was only twenty- four. People would look at me and say, You\u2019re too damn young. But you had high aspirations. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 49 Yeah, and there was a lot of that politically. Later on I became the state vice- president of the Young Democrats. I was about thirty- three, thirty- four. My good friend who we went to college together and to this day have lunch at least once a month, he was the president of the state Young Democrats and everything, and he\u2019s a lawyer, too, and we\u2019ve been friends forever and a day. And he got to name\u2014 and the key thing is I had that program and I was the chairman of the convention. He nominated the chairman of the convention. Then the guy who was the Young Democrat of the Year was a fellow by the name of Mel Carnahan, who was the governor of the State of Missouri, who was running against [ Senator John] Ashcroft and was killed in the plane crash. Right. Yeah. And still won. And still won. And I mean that was my good friend. Really. My wife was out of town. She called me up and said, Are you OK? Because that was somebody I knew really well. But you know, it\u2019s sort of funny because I showed her the book and I said, Here\u2019s a picture of me, and in \u2019 68 I didn\u2019t win the election for state representative and Mel did. Wonder where our paths would\u2019ve gone. Yeah, no kidding. And I wouldn\u2019t have gotten married if I\u2019d won that, because that\u2019s when I met my wife. And your wife\u2019s name is? [ 00: 40: 00] Mary. I would\u2019ve never called her back if I\u2019d have won that election. I\u2019d have been the hotshot up in the state. Nearly pulled it off but didn\u2019t quite. Didn\u2019t quite. Then every time I ever ran as prosecutor or judge, I won all the time. I\u2019ve won like ten elections, so I\u2019ve been through\u2014 UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 50 Interesting how things work. And where were you determined or designed to do or what are\u2014? How are the big things? My three daughters. Somebody\u2019s going to do something of some consequence? Don\u2019t know. What are you designed to do? I was always joking. There was a little girl that ran track for us who got in trouble one time. She was a white girl who was dating a black boy, and a girl yelled at her, and anyhow she took her on. And the principal, who had no sense at all, suspended her for the rest of the track meet. And Amy came crying to me and says, What do I do? What do I do, Mr. Curran? It wasn\u2019t \u201c Judge,\u201d it was \u201c Mr. Curran.\u201d And I said, Amy, we go out here on Good Friday and you run this two- mile like you\u2019ve never run it. Get mad. Get mad, Amy. And so she did, and then she wound up second in the state. She ran it. Anyhow, the thing was, my daughter really was the one who\u2014 Beth, my lawyer daughter, picked her up as a freshman \u2013 Beth was a junior \u2013 and I mean Amy was arrested for smoking pot and all this kind of stuff. The girl had scoliosis and asthma, you know, I mean\u2014 Beth said, Dad, she can run. Dad, she can run. Anyhow, so she\u2019s a coach today. But she\u2019s also a paramedic. And I said, You know, Amy could\u2019ve been in jail, but she\u2019s a paramedic. And was it that time where I said, You don\u2019t care if you are, you know, illegitimum non factum est, which means \u201c Don\u2019t let the bastards grind you down.\u201d And I said, Amy, that means you are your own person. You make your own decisions. You don\u2019t let the principal of the high school or that girl call you names. You don\u2019t let that bother you. You\u2019re Amy. So Amy someday may save somebody on the road. Who knows? And she\u2019s a teacher. Yeah, I mean that\u2019s just a great example of you just don\u2019t know where the paths are going to go or what to do. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 51 Everybody you run into in this world, you influence them in some way. It can be bad. It can be good. It can be indifferent. But you try to do it the good way. You know I\u2019m trying to influence you, don\u2019t you? I think so. I think your potential, you\u2019re going to be a doctorate, you\u2019re probably going to be a teacher, I imagine. Probably so. And so all this goes. Everything you do. I could\u2019ve been mean to you but I wouldn\u2019t. Well, I appreciate that. No, you know I\u2019m kidding. No, I\u2019m kidding. Well, listen, we\u2019re just about 12: 15 or so and I think we were going to do lunch at 12: 30, so why don\u2019t we break here? Have I tired you out especially? No, but I\u2019m going to break here. Are you learning anything? Oh, yes, I\u2019ve learned quite a bit. [ 0: 43: 47] End Track 2, Disc 2. [ End of interview]",

                            "description": "Nevada Test Site Oral History Project University of Nevada, Las Vegas Interview with Robert Curran July 18, 2005 Las Vegas, Nevada Interview Conducted By Suzanne Becker \u00a9 2007 by UNLV Libraries Oral history is a method of collecting historical information through recorded interviews conducted by an interviewer/ researcher with an interviewee/ narrator who possesses firsthand knowledge of historically significant events. The goal is to create an archive which adds relevant material to the existing historical record. Oral history recordings and transcripts are primary source material and do not represent the final, verified, or complete narrative of the events under discussion. Rather, oral history is a spoken remembrance or dialogue, reflecting the interviewee\u2019s memories, points of view and personal opinions about events in response to the interviewer\u2019s specific questions.

Suzanne Becker: Go right ahead. Robert Curran: You need my name? Yes. My name is Robert Joseph Curran. I was born August 31, 1934 in St. Louis, Missouri. OK. Talk a little bit about your childhood, some of the things that we\u2019ve been talking about. OK, well, I always considered myself a representative of the development of the middle class because when I was born, I was born in a four- family flat, rear entry, upper level, brick, no air conditioning, of course, no central heating, no hot water, in which my mother cooked on a coal stove. Not a gas stove, not an electric stove. Coal. You put coal in there. Which we had little coal heaters. And it was what you call a \u201c shotgun house,\u201d which we could shoot a shotgun in the front door and it\u2019d go out the back. Right. It\u2019s one of those long houses. Right, long. And we had an icebox, not a refrigerator. My father was a bellhop in a hotel. My mother was a hairdresser who ran away on July 4, 1925, Pontiac, Illinois, and got married. And I\u2019m the youngest of three children. OK. And what are your siblings\u2019 names? My sibling Doris Elizabeth, who is better known as Sister Mary Denis, who is a nun. She is seven years older than I am. And my brother is Thomas Patrick, and he is a retired chief technical writer for Martin Marietta Corporation. But he\u2019s five years older than me and he\u2019s retired. I\u2019m the baby. And that\u2019s it. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 2 And did you grow up in St. Louis? Lived my entire youth and life in St. Louis and I moved when I was like thirty- eight but I\u2019m still in St. Louis, basically. I became the prosecutor of Jefferson County in 1973, which is the county south of St. Louis. It\u2019s a long story, but their prosecutor went full- time and I was an assistant prosecutor in St. Louis. I knew a number of the lawyers and judges, and even though it was an elective office, everybody agreed that they would file no lawsuits if I would take the job. And really turned the office from a part- time office to a professional. And I did it for two years and then I wound up going on the bench down there. I was judge down there for twenty years and I lived there. And recently we decided we didn\u2019t need the big home anymore and we sold it and moved back to St. Louis, where I can take a bus to work. Very nice. I want to back up from that point because that takes us to the present, but I want to go back to when you were a kid because that\u2019s really interesting. A couple of things. I\u2019m wondering if you could describe what it was like growing up in that time period. Well, of course, I\u2019m old enough to remember the beginning of World War II, because I would\u2019ve been seven. I can identify that with the fact that in September of \u2019 41 Stan Musial, my favorite all- time baseball player, came up to the major leagues, and being left- handed and Stan\u2019s left- handed, was my idol. And I remember that vividly. My dad getting upset because I was seven, a little brat running around, and telling me to shut up because what was on the radio was so important, and we\u2019re talking about December 7, \u2019 41. So he was trying to listen. I think I gave you some of my American Legion oratory, and a lot of the\u2014 not pro- military, that\u2019s not exactly what I\u2019m talking to, but the service- to- country type of thing. World War II was a lot different because, we always\u2014 these guys go over to Iraq for eight months, which is tough, UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 3 but those guys went over like for four years, and they were gone, their families grew, everything. And so I sort of grew up. I would\u2019ve been seven when it started, eleven when it ended\u2014 So you have a pretty good awareness of it. Yeah, and about the same time my dad was founding the Hotel Workers\u2019 Union in St. Louis\u2014 Talk about your dad a little bit. What did he do? My dad started out\u2014 I love the fact they ran away and got married because your parents never do anything like that. You know that, don\u2019t you? [ 00: 05: 00] Right. That\u2019s pretty wild for that\u2014 Pretty wild. And nobody even knew they were married for two years, until my sister came along, and then they had to admit it. But anyhow, so they didn\u2019t get married because they had to get married. Right, they were already married. They were already married. My dad was born in Atlanta, Georgia, came to St. Louis when he was like eleven years old, and at sixteen he had to drop out of high school with my mother, got one semester of high school, which was a lot in those days. They were both born in \u2019 02 [ 1902]. My mother was very bright, but in those days the old German kinder, k\u00fcche, kirche. Do you know what those are? No. OK. Kinder is children, kirche is church, k\u00fcche is kitchen. That was the women. My father was Irish, so he was a little more liberated than the old Germans that I grew up with. But the richest kid we knew in our class in grade school was the one who owned their own house, because his father worked for the Post Office. My dad came along and founded the union and got into politics and in 1944 ran for state legislature and was elected. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 4 Now, he was a bellhop at the hotel, is that what you said? Before he founded the union, then he was president of the union and business agent for the union. So that\u2019s pretty remarkable. Yes. And if you look back, I\u2019ve got the books about him, he was educated in parochial schools and then he went to labor college, not\u2014 never got at GED or anything\u2014 he just went there to take courses at St. Louis University, and he became an expert on labor law. That\u2019s amazing. And he gets elected to the \u2019 44 legislature and becomes a member of the commission that adopted the 1945 constitution for the State of Missouri. Really. So he had a hand in that. He had a hand in that. Because the joke always was, they made what was then justices of the peace, magistrate judges, and they had to be a lawyer. And they always said he was making a job for me, because I was Danny Curran\u2019s lawyer. Everybody called me that when I was a little boy. And you want to know what type of judge I was? I was an associate circuit judge, which was the one that evolved. So he did make a job for me, as it turned out. Now, you used to spend a lot of time with him at the legislature? Yeah, I was at the legislature. When you were a kid? Yes. And my dad was a professional boxer also when he was young. Oh, really! And so I used to go down to the gym with him when I was upper grade school, early high school. Dan O\u2019Keefe, who was a fireman, used to teach me how to box. Now, the side story is that I used UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 5 to always play handball with a man whose name I thought was Tony Pip. He was an Italian guy, he liked to lose weight, because I made him run, I was [ a] kid, and he used to buy me ice cream. In 1950 I\u2019m sitting watching television and the Kefauver Committee on crime is there and they say, Would Anthony La Pippararo take the stand? And this guy was the head of the St. Louis Mafia. I had no idea. If I\u2019d known, I wouldn\u2019t have gone to have ice cream. I was liable to get blown up. But the joke always was, if somebody had ever touched me, they were in trouble with the Mob. But anyhow, yeah, I grew up a poor boy. What was your mom\u2019s name? Helen Eckhardt. She was German. I always said she\u2019s the only woman of German parentage that had three children that were 100 percent Irish. Yeah, and after my dad died, my mother went to work. She was probably the biggest baseball fan ever. And my mother and dad used to go\u2014 after we were all in college, I\u2019m the youngest. I mean do you realize how rare it was in those days to have three kids and they\u2019re all college graduates? [ 00: 10: 00] Well, yes. I think part of that is what you were talking about earlier with the rise of the middle class, and you were part of that. My dad once said, if he could make $ 100 a week for the rest of his life, he\u2019d be satisfied. I make $ 83 an hour. OK? That\u2019s a pretty good job. But you know what I\u2019m saying. Well, you\u2019ve far exceeded\u2014 I give myself in the context of what we were dealing with. It\u2019s just to get you in context of what we were dealing with there. Absolutely. Well, different times. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 6 Different times than what you are dealing with now. But, my parents never owned a home; lived in apartments, all their lives, and when my dad died at fifty- five, my mother had to go to work because she couldn\u2019t do it. What year did your father\u2014? Fifty- seven. See, this is going to come into here because he was alive when I was out here. So let\u2019s work up to that. So obviously you went to high school and college. Where\u2019d you go to college? I went to a Catholic boys\u2019 high school. And get it in context. My sister was number two in her class. My brother was number two in the class. Freshman year, I\u2019m number one in my class. So you guys are pretty good students. So second year, I letter in three sports. I lettered in track, which I lettered in all four years. I lettered in baseball, and I lettered in boxing\u2014 which you remember I said I had done that\u2014 we had a boxing team. Now, my sophomore year, I was like number five in the class, but my junior year I\u2019m number one and my senior [ year] number one, and overall I\u2019m number two because I had to show I wasn\u2019t a brain, if you know what I mean. Everybody [ thinks] you\u2019re on this other planet. Now, I\u2019m not ashamed of it. When you\u2019re a kid, fifteen years old, it\u2019s like you know everybody\u2014 and the weird thing, when I went to my fiftieth high school anniversary, everybody there thinks I was number one in the class, and I wasn\u2019t. I was number two. Well, I\u2019d say that\u2019s still pretty good standing. And I think you\u2019ve got like\u2014 you see a lot of what I did in high school. It was pretty amazing. I was extemporaneous speaker. I was a debater. I was American Legion oratory. I was Voice of Democracy. And I have a nice little medal from St. Mary\u2019s High School for all- around speech UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 7 performances. I could write a little bit at that time. Wrote an essay on religious vocations that won the State of Missouri when I was in high school. So I was a hot dog. I was a little bit of a hot dog. But I was, now you\u2019re not ashamed to say it, an intellectual hot dog. Well that\u2019s not a bad thing. No, not a bad thing. But, you know, maybe some of this macho stuff, Mary [ Vincent Ward] and I were talking about it, about being out here at the blast and volunteering to jump out of airplanes and that, was a little hiding the intellectualism that was running around that background. Keep it under wraps a little. Keep it under wraps so nobody knew about it. Now, you were ROTC [ Reserve Officer Training Corps], correct? Right. And what inspired you to do that? Just good for college? I think $ 27.50 a month was part of it. When I graduated from high school in \u2019 52, four guys out of my class went right into the military and were killed within four months in Korea, which gives you an indication of the times. And anyhow, I wanted to go to college. I was the youngest of three. My sister was already going to college. My brother was already going to college. The question of my family to me is, where are you going to college and what are you going to study? Right. So you were going to college. I was younger. My girls, my daughters had the same thing. Nobody ever asked them if they were going. They just went. They went. And so by the time they got to me, it was a given, and a good little Catholic boy went to \u201c Mizzou,\u201d the University of Missouri, which was verboten in those days because you were UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 8 supposed to go to a Catholic college, and I was sort of revolutionary. And the story I remember [ 00: 15: 00] on that was my senior year, I had written this essay that had won the state on the importance of religious vocations, and the Brothers of Mary were all trying to talk to me about what I should really do in this world; I said no, I want to be a lawyer. Anyhow, and I got in bad trouble because they had a panty raid at Mizzou about April of my senior year, and this one brother had really been talking to me, and I got the paper that morning, I threw it on his desk, about the panty raid, and I said, Now, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going. And he wanted to throw me out. I was a little cocky. Yeah. So you were in a fraternity? Yeah. It was a Catholic fraternity which is now Phi Kappa Theta. It was Phi Kappa; it\u2019s now Phi Kappa Theta. But that\u2019s the only way my parents would let me go is that you join the Catholic fraternity where I was sure about you. You\u2019ve got to remember, I have a sister that\u2019s a nun at this time, and that was it. And I really learned more about drinking beer than I did about going to church. But we won\u2019t talk about that. College, I was a very average student. I didn\u2019t excel academically or anything like that, and I never have understood why. One semester, I didn\u2019t even buy any books. All sorts of different things going on. You know, why, just everything was going on, and I don\u2019t know. And about that time, I found I had an arrhythmatic heart which people thought it was going to kill me by the time I\u2019m thirty and I\u2019m sitting here nearly seventy- one, so it didn\u2019t. But anyhow, I don\u2019t know, maybe that\u2019s where I started getting onto being Mr. Daring\u2014 When you found out about the heart. Because I didn\u2019t care. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 9 So now, you\u2019re ROTC and you graduated college and you went into the military? Yes. And where did you first end up? Went down to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, which was the artillery officers\u2019 training. Fort Sill? Yeah, Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Fort Bliss is going to come later. Fort Sill, Oklahoma is the artillery. So you started there\u2014 And I got there and I remember we all got our orders and some guys were going to Korea, even though the war was over officially. And I get Fort Lewis, Washington, which was at one time the port of embarkation to Korea, and I figured I was going over. I remember having a few drinks that night, because we all thought we were going over to Korea and I was, well, if I\u2019m out the next morning, I wasn\u2019t. And I go up there. I\u2019m assigned what they call a \u201c bastard battalion.\u201d It wasn\u2019t assigned to a division artillery [ battalion], field artillery battalion, 155 howitzer, it was assigned to Sixth Army. So I\u2019m assigned to that and I have this wonderful winter in the rain up at Fort Lewis, out in the field doing all kinds of things, and we\u2019re a service battery, so basically we\u2019re transporting artillery rounds. We weren\u2019t really firing guns that much. And comes the spring and you\u2014 oh! And I met a colonel while I was there, Colonel Powell, and I can\u2019t think of his first name. I know where he\u2019s buried; I could take you to Arlington [ National] Cemetery and show you his burial place, but I can\u2019t think of his first name, which I think is the first sign of old age. But anyhow, when I walked in and reported, I remember vividly being in Rawlins, Wyoming on the way, in a snowstorm, trying to get St. Louis radio to find out if my father had won the election. I mean it was the \u2019 56 election. And I get up there like a day or two later and Colonel Powell says, Lieutenant, do you have a car? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 10 I said, Yeah, it\u2019s out there. I had a \u201c Stevenson for President\u201d sticker. And he says to me, You picked the wrong man. And I said, No, I picked the right man. The people picked the wrong man. At which time he laughed and he said, Are you a lawyer? And I said, No, I\u2019m going to be one. And he was a friend of Melvin Belli\u2019s, who is a very famous lawyer from San Francisco. Very famous lawyer from San Francisco. So he and I used to talk all the time. And his daughter came up one time for a dance and, eh, single lieutenant, she was little, I was little, take her out. I was the one he asked to escort her. He trusted me enough and I asked to escort her to the dance. And so he\u2019s the guy that was in charge and he\u2019s [ 00: 20: 00] sending people to [ Las] Vegas. I had a captain who was an idiot. I was in a unit that was going to Germany, and I wasn\u2019t going with them. So you wanted out of there. I wanted out of there, and so I called Colonel Powell and he said, What job do you want? And I said, Special Services sounds pretty good to me. In charge of a movie theater, bars, I mean this sounds good. And that\u2019s why I was a lieutenant and everybody else was\u2014 So you no longer wanted to be in that unit, you were hating the weather? Oh, yeah. Have you ever been to Fort Lewis? No. The saying is, \u201c If you can see Mt. Rainier, it\u2019s going to rain. If you can\u2019t see it, it\u2019s raining.\u201d And you were at attention more than three minutes and moss grew up the side of you. So I hated it. And I\u2019ve got sinuses anyhow. And so you wanted out, so the middle of the desert sounded like a good idea. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 11 The whole thing sounded like a great idea. And this is what he offered you. He gave you a choice of coming out to Nevada and being in charge of Special Services? That\u2019s right. So you\u2019re twenty- two and you come out to Nevada. I get in my car April 4, 1957. Memories\u2014 I looked these orders up, you know. Nineteen fifty- seven, I drove down the highway and I stopped at the Presidio [ San Francisco, California], which if you\u2019ve ever been to the Presidio, it\u2019s gorgeous. Sixth Army, get all my orders and everything straightened out, and I drove to Los Angeles, to Palos Verdes Estates where my cousin lived, visit them, and hit the highway from Los Angeles. I got here around April 11 or 12, I would think. That\u2019s basically what I remember. So what\u2019d you think of the [ Nevada] test site when you first saw it? Well, the first thing I see is Vegas. I stopped in Vegas. And I pulled up to the Sahara Hotel, which winds up coming in out of this whole year. And there was a movie at the time, Meet Me in Las Vegas or something, with Dan Dailey, the dancer, in it, and the first person I ever saw in Vegas was Dan Dailey coming out of the Sahara to get in a car. And I thought this was the glamour spot of the rest of the world after seeing this movie. And so then you get on the highway north and you make the turn at Indian Springs. It\u2019s a little different than the city. It\u2019s a little different. And you know all of a sudden we\u2019re in this land of\u2014 I mean I was familiar with the wooden barracks- type thing. When I was at Mizzou, you still had some of the World War II buildings, so I was familiar with that temp building. And you know we\u2019re up there. Younger officers were in a barracks. We didn\u2019t have a BOQ [ Bachelor Officers\u2019 Quarters] or a UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 12 private room. We were just in the barracks, and there was a parking lot outside the barracks that the coyotes used to run around in. You\u2019d have to chase them off when you went to get your car, you know, get out of here, get out, doggie. They didn\u2019t bother anything but they were out there and they\u2019d howl at night. It was really interesting. We were sort of on the, I want to think it would be north end of the camp. I\u2019m not sure, but I recall that you went in toward Mercury and you go to the left to Desert Rock, and then you hooked another right once you got in Desert Rock, which would mean that street was running north and south. So you were in there pretty far. Oh, we were in the back. Yeah, we were in the back. And the theater and the two\u2014 when you see the picture with the two\u2014 with the concrete pads, there are two big concrete pads, and the one on the side towards Vegas is going to be the mess hall, and the one on the other side is going to be the theater, which I was in charge of, so I know where it was. Yeah. And the mess hall, we let the cooks come to the show free and we ate in the middle of the night. Yeah. A little do- for- do, you know what I mean? That\u2019s why I know where both of them were. Did you know what the Nevada Test Site was prior to coming out? Were you familiar with it, and were you familiar with what was going on here? I\u2019m really trying to go back and I can\u2019t remember. Because it\u2019s still fairly new at this point. You talked to my wife yesterday and she said, knowing me, it was sort of the controlled danger type thing. That I tried to jump out of airplanes and I only weighed 118 pounds and you had to be 135 to pull the [ para] chute. So I needed something else to do whatever I wanted to prove my [ 00: 25: 00] manhood or whatever you want to call it. Still sort of a little cocky, swaggering. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 13 So talk about a little bit what your job was specifically with the test site, because it sounds like you did a variety of things but one of your main jobs was to coordinate the entertainment. I was in charge of the theater, the sports program. My office was in the library, which will be on the other side of the mess hall. It\u2019s right there. That was where we had the library for the troops, and we had a sports program. We had tours to\u2014 we didn\u2019t do much of that. We did that early and we didn\u2019t do that later on, because we had groups of people come in. But my main job was to be sort of the liaison between Vegas, and really more than Vegas, the entertainment group, the variety club. Are you familiar with the variety club? Yeah, but explain what it is in your\u2014 It was the charitable arm of the entertainment people. And part of their thing that they contributed was to entertain the troops who were at Camp Desert Rock. Now, you\u2019re in the Army, correct? I don\u2019t think we stated\u2014 Oh, yeah. Artillery. Field artillery. I wasn\u2019t a lawyer. Not yet. No, not even close. So you\u2019re now out at the test site and you\u2019re coordinating between the variety club, you\u2019re bringing entertainment out to Camp Desert Rock, yes? That was part of it. And my wife loves the story, the one sergeant who hated the captain as bad as I did and wanted to get out of Fort Lewis, I got him out of there, and the captain who was an idiot didn\u2019t know it, and he came and reported to me. He was my sponsor. He said, Lieutenant, Sergeant Little reporting for duty, and he started laughing and he said, Captain said, \u201c Where\u2019d you get these orders from? Do you know anything about it?\u201d And he said, You swore me to secrecy. And that was our captain. And he [ Little] was single. He was from L. A. He loved coming down. Anyhow he said, You ought to have UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 14 heard the names he called you, Lieutenant. There wasn\u2019t a thing he could do about it because you had the colonel\u2019s signature on it. Anyhow, so Bob Little and I used to drive in\u2014 Bob Little? That was the sergeant, yeah, and I used to drive in, and there were two \u2019 56 staff cars on post. Everything else was \u2019 52 because of the desert and everything. And we had one because we came into Vegas, and the general had the other. But both of them, if there was a general on post, I lost it because they had general\u2019s plates on them. And of course they were covered. And we used to pull in and we\u2019d come into Vegas and we\u2019d drive about the first sixty miles and I\u2019d sit in the front seat and we\u2019re talking, and then we\u2019d come into Vegas and I\u2019d get in the back seat, and we\u2019d wheel to mainly the Desert Inn or the Sahara, the two places we went, and he\u2019d wheel that car in there and pull it up, the general\u2019s plate cover was on there, and he\u2019d get out and he\u2019d go around to the back and snap that door open and salute, and everybody\u2019s waiting for some general or something and here was a second lieutenant. We used to laugh. We thought it was funny. We did it all the time. Really impressed people. But Bob was like a year older than I am. So you guys were having a ball doing that. Yeah. So what kinds of entertainment did you bring out there? We started the first few weeks, we had a stage out there, sound system. In fact, I think that one thing says I was building the\u2014 That\u2019s really interesting. I was in charge of it. I wasn\u2019t building it. I didn\u2019t know that there was a stage out there till I saw that. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 15 There was a stage out there and we had a sound system. We had dressing rooms for the people. I know we can\u2019t go out there because of the weather, but I could probably find it. Where was it, do you remember? It was back in that back part where we were, because that was where it was open where the parking lots were and everything. It was the north end. It was pretty well open. As I recall, it was over there. Anyhow, the first one we had was Jeanette MacDonald, who was a singer. Johnny Puleo, the little midget in Harmonica Gang? Yes, a bunch of little midgets played in Harmonica. I remember that. I don\u2019t know. I get a little lost on which one. Then we had Ming  and I\u2019m going to law school. You know how it is. Things go on. Yeah, life just\u2014 Life goes on. And very nice. Very nice person. I think a great singer, although my wife says, I don\u2019t think she sings that well. But anyhow. So you brought entertainment out. Yes, and so those were shows that we did out there. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 17 OK. And you also took troops in to the city, correct? Then it got too hot. So your stage was outside. Yes. At the test site. Now we\u2019re getting into the end of June. Because I know she was there at the end of June, and I know her birthday\u2019s July 2, and one of the first times they came in was her birthday, I know that. My memory\u2019s not bad, is it? It\u2019s pretty good. Anyhow, so then we could no longer do that, and the hotels would give us on a Sunday afternoon the room. Which is? The showroom. And the soft drink companies of Las Vegas, we varied it, would donate two sodas per soldier we brought in. We couldn\u2019t have liquor because a lot of the people were under twenty- one. And we used to bring them in the buses because we had all the buses to go out to the desert, to go out to the site. And we used to bring them in, and then we\u2019d stage them coming back, so if somebody wanted to stay, you know\u2014 They could stay longer or leave earlier. Yeah, leave earlier or whatever they wanted to do. First show I remember was George Gobel, and what I remember was not George Gobel, it was the DeCastro Sisters singing \u201c Teach Me Tonight.\u201d I mean this for some reason stands out in my mind. We had Jack Benny, Gisele [ 00: 35: 00] McKenzie. My great moment in time, I was announcing when the buses were leaving and Jack Benny walked out on the stage, and I was a ham, and I crossed my arms and looked at UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 18 him and said, Well. You don\u2019t remember Jack Benny? That was his famous line. I couldn\u2019t resist. We had Carol Channing, which was what the Tropicana opened\u2014 it was the opening show. No, I think Eddie Fisher was the opening show, and she was the second show. So did you guys go to the Tropicana? Did you go to\u2014? Went to the Tropicana. We went to the Desert Inn, which was where Jack Benny was. We had Peter Lynn Hayes and Mary Healey, George Gobel. I\u2019m trying to think. We had a bunch of shows. I mean it was, I\u2019ll be very frank, I worked my butt off, because I was going out on shots, I was running the library, I\u2014 you know. Right. So you did a lot. I did a lot, yeah. So a couple questions. How often did you guys come into town for the shows? Oh, like every other week or so. OK. I\u2019m just curious how frequent that was. Things started to peter out out there, as far as above- ground testing, after Smoky, which is August 31 [ 1957]. September and October, one of the things, maybe I\u2019m wrong, you can look it up, I think most of those were underground. I mean you have a list, don\u2019t you? Well, they definitely started going underground in 1962. We went underground for a lot of those. But it probably started before then. The official moratorium came in \u2019 62 [ LTBT 1963]. In \u2019 62. But aren\u2019t we, in \u2019 57, the last actual\u2014 where they brought in troops and that? I know the military presence wasn\u2019t out there for that long a time. It was very early on. So that is something that we can look up. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 19 I think we may have been the last military presence. There may have been, I don\u2019t know. But I mean I\u2019m coming back here, I\u2019m working forty hours a week, going to night law school. I\u2019m not catching up on the news from Las Vegas, no. Well, OK, now, tell me about the other part of your job. You were out there for some of the shots. Yeah. Ones I can specifically recall by name: Hood, Priscilla, Diablo, Smoky, that by name go boom, boom, boom. I was out for more than that. OK, right, but those are the ones that stand out. Those are ones that I can tell you things that happened with them. So I\u2019m curious, here you are, you\u2019re twenty- two years old and you hadn\u2019t really been out to the desert before\u2014 Never left St. Louis before. And you\u2019re working for, at the time, the Nevada Test Site. It\u2019s a pretty, I don\u2019t want to say glamorous, but it\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019s a big deal. I don\u2019t know we looked at it that big a deal, I really don\u2019t\u2014 Well, that\u2019s my question. Did you realize what you were involved in? No. You want an honest answer? That\u2019s about as honest as I can get you, really. No, no, I don\u2019t think so. Right. Were you aware of the atomic testing that was going on? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, we were all\u2014 when we were oriented when we first came down here, we were aware of everything that was going on. What did they talk to you about? What did they tell you? How was your introduction to the site? Well, of course, in those days, they really didn\u2019t know what the heck was going on. We had a few courses. In fact, that article that I\u2019ve got is really backwards, because that was before I got UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 20 here that I was in the class with the guy from Hawaii who said\u2014 he was in Hiroshima. His family got caught in Japan in World War II. He lived through Hiroshima. He was in the Army with me. And that was before I was here. That was before you got here. Yeah. So I did know somebody who had been through\u2014 had a little bit of the thing. But we had no idea if the chain reaction was going to stop, or where it was going to stop. I mean, were we going to be part of it? We really didn\u2019t know. But you\u2019re twenty- two. You\u2019re not thinking of these things. You\u2019re Teflon. You\u2019re foolproof. Nobody can do anything to you at twenty- two, I don\u2019t think, can they? I don\u2019t think so. Well, now, I\u2019m just curious if you remember what that first experience was like when they told you you were going to be going out on a test. What was that like? What were some of the things you were thinking about? Well, you\u2019ve got to get us all into context. One of the stories I just thought of last night and I was [ 00: 40: 00] telling my wife was one of the guys was in G- 4, which was Services and all this kind of stuff. We had in the unit a doctor that was bitching about dust control, which you know the desert, the dust always\u2014 It\u2019s dusty. And when those clouds came over and dropped about three foot of water right into their camp, and him calling up and saying, Did you like our solution to your dust control? I mean, I remember that. So we were a little loosy- goosy. Anything. I\u2019m not sure if the first one I went out on was Hood. I want to think it was. You know Hood\u2019s the biggest one ever, blown up UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 21 [ largest atmospheric test at NTS, 74kt]. It was a balloon. I want to think it was. And I remember they had the pigs out there, where they were testing like sunscreen? The animal pigs. Yeah, animal pigs. Right. And I want to think that\u2019s the one where we got up out of the trenches and looked back and there was a rabbit who had been running across the desert who was frozen and fried in mid- air. We always figured, well, I guess if we had stuck our head out of the trench, we would\u2019ve been frozen in mid- air and fried, too. We learned it as we went along. Part of the reason we couldn\u2019t be too afraid was we were in charge. We had like thirty- five people. I was a second lieutenant but they may have been majors and colonels and everything. But I was in charge. They did what I said. And what did you do? What were you in charge of? OK, the afternoon before, we usually went out. We showed them where the trenches were. We showed them the tower. The soldiers. The other soldiers. Yeah, the ones we were training. We had our bus full, thirty- five people. And we basically explained to them all the safety precautions and what we expected them to do and what we were going to do. We had the shovel in case the trench came in. We told them if you get up and somebody\u2019s buried, you yell, we\u2019ll come. And basically taught them how to cover their eyes and turn and to protect themselves. And we had been out there, you know, trained to do that. And there was always a little ramp that went down in the trench. Then the trenches went out to the side. We were in that little ramp. We had to be the first ones out, and we counted. We counted to the blast, and when the blast went over, we knew the\u2014 because the speed of sound is where the UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 22 light\u2019s coming. No, excuse me, the speed of light\u2019s where the light\u2019s coming. The speed of sound to the blast. And so we knew when the blast went over, we could look at the cloud. So like lightning. When you see it go and you count? That\u2019s right. But we knew you could look up at the cloud by the time the blast went over. Right away, if you\u2019d looked at, you\u2019d have been blind. But we knew you could. So when we ran out of the thing, our first reaction was everybody up, everybody out! Look at the cloud! What did you think the first time you actually saw the cloud? You saw the blast happen and\u2014 I figured it was like you look at the big, tall building, it looks like it\u2019s falling on you, I thought, uh oh, it\u2019s coming back. We\u2019re going to get all that tower rained on us. And we used to joke about it. After a while, we used to joke about it. One day, it did it. They had to burn our uniforms. Take a shower. You know, I think, we took a shower, big deal, with the radiation. What shot was that, do you remember? I have no idea. I can\u2019t remember. I could give you a name but I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m not going to tell you something I don\u2019t know. Now, what\u2014 so many questions. I guess first of all I\u2019m curious as to what your reaction was. There are so few people in the world that have seen an actual atmospheric nuclear test, atomic test. You see in the pictures the enormous, brilliantly- colored clouds. Well, you could tell by how dark the color, from violet to purple, how dirty it was, because it was how much dirt went up in there. And, of course, the biggest thing that always fascinated me is you realize it\u2019s not a mushroom. It\u2019s a circle and the mushroom stem comes from the vacuum that\u2019s pulling up the dirt. And that\u2019s what gave it the dirt and the color. And we could tell how dirty you were\u2014 out by St. George, Utah and Enterprise and those babies were [ 00: 45: 00] going to get\u2014 by how dark it was. And we used to refer to it as a \u201c purple onion\u201d because it darkened UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 23 into a purple when the dust got up in there. It was really a little lighter than that when we first looked at it. Yeah. But as more dust went into it, the darker it got? Yeah. I\u2019m trying to think, my first reaction to it, I really\u2014 you know, you get sort of jaded because you went through it so many times. But were you nervous at all? What do you mean by \u201c nervous\u201d? I\u2019ve been a judge for thirty years. Every time I take the bench, I\u2019m nervous. But then. But it\u2019s a controlled nervousness, yeah. I think probably because I was responsible for these other people and everything, that my reaction was more to make sure they were all right\u2014 OK, so you\u2019re concentrating on the\u2014 \u2014 than to just sit there and, oh, isn\u2019t it pretty. I mean there was a little more\u2014 I think later on you maybe looked a little calmer at, hey, isn\u2019t that pretty. It was. It was beautiful. It was gorgeous. Awesome. Awesome! Did you realize the power of it? Oh, sure. Well, you just had that blast go. What do you think went over your head in that trench? You don\u2019t think it was quiet, do you? No. Tell me what it was like being in the trench when that happened. Well, I was a little bit claustrophobic. But I had the exit, didn\u2019t I, I guess. OK. Yeah, you were on the exit. I was on the exit, which was lucky. I don\u2019t know. I think the trench itself was just like any other hunk of ground out in the middle of the desert. It was dirty. A lot of it was sort of insecure. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 24 Unstable. You always check and make sure that you weren\u2019t in the place that might fall in when you\u2014. Did they ever fall in? Did they ever collapse? I never had it. But we used to carry trenching tools in case it did. That was our job. And you said they\u2019re what, about six feet deep? Well, I know exactly. They were six foot deep and they were two foot wide. And you had about three foot of space per person. I can tell you that, because there was always a thirty- five- man bus. I was number thirty- five, which meant there were seventeen on one side of me and seventeen on the other side. And those trenches were fifty foot long. You want to divide it up? It\u2019s going to come out three foot\u2014 Three feet a person. That\u2019s right. So what are the procedures? You said that you trained them in this. What types of procedures did you guys have? Well, we were also the last ones down. First ones out, last ones in. That\u2019s right. What was that, FIFO, first in, first out. I know that\u2019s not dealing with the trenches but that may give you the picture. So you went up and down that trench, and you had told them the day before that you kneel or bend. You had to be low because this stuff\u2019s flying over, and even the two- foot trench, some of it\u2019s going to hit the back of that trench. You know that, right? Yeah. And we had metal pots, metal helmets on. We had gas masks on. And other than that, you had on fatigues and there was no special clothing or anything. And basically you\u2019d get them out there. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 25 We had been out there the afternoon, we\u2019d put them in the trench, we\u2019d told them what to do, and then basically when I got them out there that night, right before\u2014 well, no, I probably wasn\u2019t in the trench till like fifteen seconds before. And you\u2019d make sure everybody was doing what you said, you know, and don\u2019t anybody dare get up till I tell you. And then you\u2019d go down and you\u2019d do your\u2014 what you were\u2014 Cover your eyes. Cover your eyes. Because all you had there was, of course, you had gas masks. You just had the small thing. No goggles, just the mask? No, when you\u2019re above ground you\u2019ve got goggles. OK, this is when we\u2019re in the trench. We\u2019ll talk about above ground later. But did you have them? No, you didn\u2019t have goggles because you were down and you were in the shade from the heat and the light. And you were the last one [ 00: 50: 00] down there. And I really think sort of, to a certain extent, you were so busy making sure, you know, because I mean above\u2014 one of those guys, gotten them blown away, I don\u2019t know what the heck would\u2019ve happened. We never had that, but I don\u2019t know. So you\u2019re concentrating on making sure everybody\u2019s OK. And I want to think Hood, but I don\u2019t remember. There were two big ones right in the beginning. One I was in the field for, and I want to think it was Hood. And the other one I was back, and all I remember, these were at 4: 30 in the morning, I was in the theater, I wasn\u2019t at the BOQ. I was in the theater, and the blast put a dent in the side of the theater. The theater was one of those old metal buildings. And one of the sides, and I thought, oh my God, is this thing going to come in? I remember that. And of course I was in the theater. I wasn\u2019t down or anything. I was what, fifteen, twenty miles away, I guess. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 26 That\u2019s pretty significant. Yeah, but it definitely dented, I remember. And I\u2019m confused as to\u2014 I want to think I was out for it. I want to think that was the famous rabbit that got killed across the back. It could\u2019ve been Hood I was back there. It could\u2019ve been another one early. But there was another big one early that\u2019s with it. Not Smoky or\u2014? No, Smoky was what, forty- four kilotons? No, Smoky was completely different. There was nobody in the trench for Smoky that I know of. I don\u2019t think there was anybody in there, because of what they were doing and what they were testing. You know, a lot of what they were testing now, as I said, they had the pigs out there. Yeah, tell me about that a little bit. See, you could defend yourself against the light and the heat\u2014 And that\u2019s what they used the pigs for, to see what would happen to them? Yeah. We probably had them for lunch at the mess\u2014 no, I don\u2019t think so. I shouldn\u2019t say a thing like that because they\u2019re not true. Well, you know, you hear stories. I\u2019ve heard about the pigs but I was just wondering what you remember about them and what they were used for. Well, I wasn\u2019t involved in that. You just remember being out there. I remember being out there, and they were using such stuff, like we used to talk about sunscreen, to see if that protected your skin. So they were putting stuff on the pigs to see if it would\u2014 UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 27 Yeah, see how you could protect a human being from the thing. You got to get this all in context. You got the light and the heat, number one, the speed of sound. The speed of light, excuse me. I keep on doing that. You had the blast, speed of sound, and third, you have radiation. So if you\u2019re defending yourself, you go shade\u2014 So you don\u2019t want to look at the light. You don\u2019t want to be by the light. Well, you don\u2019t want the light to burn you either. Not like the sun, my God, you know, it\u2019s hot. And I mean you could feel that in the trench, by the way. You could feel the heat. You could feel the heat, even though you were under. Yeah, I mean it probably\u2014 you think it\u2019s hot out, what is it? Probably out there right now it\u2019s 126. Of course, we\u2019re 4: 30 in the morning, which meant it was about 55. It probably went up to 126. Yeah. But it was hot. It was hot. You could feel it. You could definitely feel it. But no, and when you covered, you could see your bones. It X- rayed and you definitely could see your hands, or a lot of times you would have your elbow up, you know, over your eyes, and you could see those\u2014 I know what those bones in there look like. They weren\u2019t broke so. But anyhow, you could see those. But first reaction. Impressed, yeah. Scared, never. Never. I really can\u2019t say I was ever afraid. I think you have the momentary thing right before it goes off where I hope the chain reaction stops. I hope these idiots know what they\u2019re talking about. But true fear fear, no, no, no. No, I can\u2019t say that. There was probably that momentary\u2014 which I think in my letter you get a little bit of that, not really from me but from somebody else\u2019s\u2014[ see Robert Curran letter of July 1957 regarding witnessing 17 kt atmospheric atomic detonation, Diablo, from trench at NTS] Well, I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s just that, like you were saying, that moment of just we really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 28 And we\u2019re here and there\u2019s no way to get out because if you were to decide you were going to run, that baby\u2019s going to catch up with you. So it\u2019s better to stay in the trenches. So you mentioned being out in the field, too. [ 00: 55: 00] What was that like? What do you mean, what\u2014? I\u2019m sorry, I don\ufffd\ufffdt\u2014 Well, as opposed to being in the trenches. I mean\u2014 Oh, that was\u2014 you were ten miles back. So you weren\u2019t nearly as close. They had those. In fact, they got a really good thing at the [ Atomic Testing] museum where they have these benches, and they were there. They were there. And that\u2019s where we were. Now, when I was there, I had Canadians, on Smoky. Smoky\u2019s famous, you know that, don\u2019t you? Yeah. It was the dirtiest one in history, and we\u2019re not going to talk why it was dirtiest one in history, but it was the dirtiest one in history, and I had a bus full of Canadians. Soldiers? Queen\u2019s Own Rifles, which were sort of like our Special Forces. These guys didn\u2019t have summer uniforms. They double- timed everyplace in winter uniforms. They were the toughest human beings I have ever known. Two paratroopers in the NCO [ Noncommissioned Officers\u2019] Club one night decided to pick on one of those guys. Called him a pansy or something because he had to wear a uniform a lot, and they took a punch at him and they both wound up in the hospital. These were the toughest human beings I have ever seen. But you\u2019d go over\u2014 I remember there was a guard at the bank in Vegas where we took the money for the theater who was Canadian. And he asked me to go out and talk to the Canadians about coming in and he had a barbeque for them at UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 29 his house and that. And so you\u2019d go over to where the Canadians were, and I want to think it was a colonel, a lieutenant colonel, and you\u2019d walk in and a sergeant would greet you, and I mean they would right away, if you wanted a gin- and- tonic, you can have it. I never did. My father was an alcoholic. I\u2019ve had a few drinks in my life but I don\u2019t even drink anymore. That\u2019s nothing with me or anything, it\u2019s just I don\u2019t. But anyhow, they would offer you iced tea or whatever, you know, and before you went in to see the colonel, they sat that down and you talked to him. Great people. Really great. Very polite. Wonderful. And the weather was terrible, coming up to Smoky. I mean it was bad. Was it just raining or windy or\u2014? A little bit of everything. Well, the monsoon, you\u2019re talking late August, right, I mean\u2014 Yeah, and you think the desert, people don\u2019t realize\u2014 You\u2019ve lived in the desert long enough to realize that in late August or around in there, you get bad weather. So we\u2019re talking August 31 is when the shot\u2014 it was supposed to run from like about the 25th. So we\u2019d come into town sometime in the evening, and I can\u2019t remember where AEC [ Atomic Energy Commission] headquarters was. Downtown. And it had a light on there. And we\u2019d sneak out and look at the light. And if it was red, we just stayed in town and partied. And that night I recall it going green and we said, we\u2019d better go. It was my birthday August 31, so what were we doing in town on Friday night? We were celebrating my birthday, right? And I remember flying that highway out there to get there. We did. We got there in time. I was driving. That highway was [ makes a sound indicating the highway was clear]. And I was sober. But it was still\u2014 UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 30 Oh, it\u2019s still a good hour\u2019s drive. We did it in about fifty- two minutes or something. I was going 106, I remember. Anyhow, but you know how flying it was. But anyhow, we got out there and walked on the bus about 12: 30, my twenty- third birthday, and the Canadians break out with \u201c Happy Birthday, Leftenant.\u201d And then they were all kidding me about, You wanted this big birthday candle for your birthday, didn\u2019t you? You\u2019re the reason we\u2019ve been here all week, you know, and all this kind of stuff. That I remember vividly. And then we go out. We\u2019re back now. We\u2019re above ground. Now, we\u2019ve got the glasses. Even with glasses, you\u2019re still not supposed to look directly at the blast. But again, I\u2019m the one that\u2019s got to tell them when to take off the glasses because if you got the glasses on, you can\u2019t see the cloud. And so now we\u2019re ten miles back. We\u2019re not talking eight, ten seconds from [ 01: 00: 00] blast anymore, are we? We\u2019re talking forty- five, fifty seconds, something like that. And you told them to watch the road because the blast is going to kick up the dirt. And of course, about half of them listen to you. And when the blast hit, about half of them wound up flat on their butts because the blast hit them and knocked them down. Shock wave? Yeah, the shock wave, whatever word. See, I use different terminology sometimes. See, we\u2019ve now sophisticated some of this. We just said \u201c the blast.\u201d But when it hit them, you know. But I remember we were standing back there, what you had to do is get down and sort of turn your head because you had the helmet on. Because the missiling, you know, the major deaths in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, everything else, was missiling, where the blast takes and throws things and turns them into bullets or some kind\u2014 Debris. Flying objects. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 31 That\u2019s the main cause of death in Hiroshima, and that\u2019s what you had to be careful of. And we knew that. But anyhow, when it went up, that baby was purple. We knew it was dirty. We knew it was dirty. And the reason for it is they backed it into a hill. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll even admit this today, but they backed it into a hill because when you have a blast, you create a vacuum. We\u2019ve already talked about the stem of the mushroom. OK, so when it bounces off the ground, the face is round, and when the beginning edge of the shock wave, or blast, bounces off the ground, it bounces back up into the vacuum, right? And then it comes out\u2014 I\u2019m trying to think of how to express it properly. It comes out and it catches up with the one that\u2019s against the atmosphere. Because it\u2019s in a vacuum, right? It catches up with it and presents what they call a mach- Y stem which intensifies the blast. Because you have two blasts\u2014 Right. It\u2019s double the\u2014 OK, the reason they backed it up in the hill was that they wanted to create what they called a triple mach- Y stem, not only when it bounces off the ground but when it bounced off the hill, it came and intensified that shock wave. That\u2019s why it\u2019s backed up against the hill. What did it do? It got in part of that hill. What causes it to be dirty? The dirt that\u2019s radiation and takes everything out. And that\u2019s why that was the one that was so famous and that\u2019s the one where people died of leukemia. That\u2019s the one where they contacted people like me from CDC, Centers for Disease Control\u2014 Now, I just want to stop for one second. I need to pause to make a CD identification, and then just go on. [ 01: 03: 20] End Track 2, Disc 1. [ 00: 00: 00] Begin Track 2, Disc 2. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 32 OK. So speaking of dirty blasts, now is this something that you ever thought about when you were out there? Did they ever talk to you about it? I don\u2019t remember. We knew how to defend ourselves. And I remember they had shot one in Frenchman\u2019s Flat. We were at Yucca. I don\u2019t think we had anything in Frenchman\u2019s. They had used up Frenchman\u2019s earlier where they had fired one underground and they had a robot that they sent down underneath there and took pictures of the interior, and of course what causes jewelry, what causes gems? Heat and pressure. So what do you have underneath that ground? Heat and pressure. What do you have covering the walls of where that came? Gems. Why can\u2019t you go down and mine them? Because I give my wife that diamond and I kill her in about a half an hour. It\u2019s all radioactive down in there. I\u2019m sure that they can take you out here right now and show you some of those caverns because they have robots that they can send in there where those things were and they will be gorgeous, beautiful. Well, diamonds, emeralds, rubies, whatever the composition of the soil was that they heated and pressurized. But you can\u2019t get to them. You can\u2019t use them. No way. So where was I at? You got me lost. No, I got me lost. Well, I was just curious if you ever thought to yourself, wow, this may not be so good, or there\u2019s a possibility of contamination, or if they ever mentioned it, or if it just wasn\u2019t even an issue. I don\u2019t remember. I really don\u2019t. In fact, everybody asks me, have you ever had any aftereffects? And for years, if I went swimming and didn\u2019t put on a T- shirt, I\u2019d get a rash on my back. One doctor one day said, Where were you exposed to radiation? He said, You have radiation burns on your back. Did you know that? And it only comes out if I\u2019m in the sun. If I have this shirt on like I do today, it\u2019s not going to come out, but if I\u2019m in the sun, it\u2019s UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 33 coming out. It\u2019s going to come out. Do I have some memorabilia from the fact that it was radiation? Yeah. Did I get that the day the tower backed up? Yeah, what happened with that? Well, we\u2019re joking as we always were about the cloud backing up on us, right? And all of a sudden, you hear this stuff on your steel pot going tink, tink. So the tower, basically after the shot goes off, disintegrates. The tower wasn\u2019t steel. I\u2019m trying to think, what was the stuff we had in chemistry? My wife told me last night, and I can\u2019t remember, that burned real quickly, because they wanted something that dissolved. Because it goes with the blast. It just dissolves with the blast. Yeah. I remember walking out after the blast was over, this is how casual we were, to ground zero within an hour or two of the blast, and standing on the concrete pad with the parts of the tower that showed you the curvature of the blast, but it didn\u2019t quite hit the ground because they didn\u2019t want it to hit the ground. Those towers were basically 500 foot high. I don\u2019t want to get too scientific, but a 20- kiloton blast will not cover 500 feet, and that\u2019s why they were that high. We had one or two balloons, but most of them were towers. And I\u2019ll think of the name of that metal, but they weren\u2019t really steel. They were\u2014 I don\u2019t remember. I\u2019ll think of it. I\u2019ll have you call one of these people over at the Chemistry Department and they\u2019ll tell you what it was. But yeah, you got the little dings. And then on the way back in, because we came through Mercury. We went back to the highway and up from Mercury to go out because the road went out from Mercury, even though we were further in. And I think we stopped in Mercury and they gave us new uniforms. And had to shower off? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 34 In fact, I think this is part of the reason, the letter I wrote from the trenches in pencil? The reason [ 00: 05: 00] for that, we didn\u2019t have our wallets with us, we didn\u2019t have\u2014 I couldn\u2019t have had a watch on, I couldn\u2019t have had a ring on, because if we had come back that time, we would\u2019ve lost all that. See, we used to lock them up before we went out. So you couldn\u2019t wear anything out there. And that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t have a pen. I had a pencil. Sure, that makes sense. But they took our uniforms. We all had a little badge- like thing which you can see over at the [ museum], and I know somebody that has one. A little badge- like thing [ dosimeter] that you put the film thing in there, and they measured the radiation by how much the film developed, and if you got a certain level of radiation, you went home. I never got there, obviously. Now, they have your radiation records? Do you have\u2014? I have no idea. All I know is in St. Louis, where I\u2019m from, they had a big records center fire back a few years ago, and the records that were destroyed were from 1912 to 1960. And I know some of mine were in there because they\u2019ve asked me for orders and stuff. You know, when the CDC, they wanted orders, too, I could tell them who was there and things like that. So are they gone? I don\u2019t know. But that would have to be the records center, and I really have never\u2014 what I have, you\u2019ve seen a lot. I have some other ones that just say \u201c orders\u201d and I was doing this or I was doing that, but I didn\u2019t think they affected what you particularly wanted. So as far as you know, your radiation level is minimal? You\u2019ve got no adverse effects other than some radiation exposure on your back? Never. And I\u2019ve been checked a couple of times. My cholesterol is only 54. Maybe it radiated that. I don\u2019t know. Maybe that\u2019s a good thing. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 35 Do you think that there was exposure out there? Oh, yeah! I know there were! Why did people die? A lot of leukemia out of there. Well, I mean there\u2019s a lot of people that say no, that\u2019s impossible, it couldn\u2019t have happened out there. If you were that close? Yeah. I would think that probably St. George, Utah got more than we did. We got backed- up on one time; St. George, Utah, or Enterprise, whichever one you want, the sheep ranch, you\u2019re familiar with the sheep ranch in between there and Utah. They lost a lot of sheep out there. The old joke is, a friend of mine is a lawyer who was a pilot. And he used to fly through the clouds. And he was at Bikini. Flew through the clouds. And the joke was, when he was in my courtroom, that if the lights went out, nobody would know the difference because we both glowed. We didn\u2019t, of course, but I mean that was always the joke, if Greg O\u2019Shea and myself were in the room together, that the whole thing would glow. He would have had nothing to do with this. He was on the big ones. Right, over in the Pacific. The Pacific. He was a pilot and he flew right through the clouds, picked up samples. Those were big, though. Those were some of probably biggest ones. Oh, those were megatons. We\u2019re talking kilotons. They were megatons. Yeah. Those guys had more than we did. Now, I don\u2019t really know how to phrase this. Did you have any opinion on nuclear testing when you were out there? Now, obviously, it grew into this very subversive issue, but you were out there pretty early on in the beginning of the program. No. I went to the museum and they wanted to talk about we were the heroes of the Cold War. There was an article in the New York Times that somebody sent me that said, we were the heroes UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 36 because we were the sacrificial\u2014 we\u2019re the guinea pigs of the era. I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t feel that way. I was out there, I was doing a job. I\u2019m not altruistic about it, but I\u2019m also not [ a] condemnation person about it. It was something we did. And if you read some of my stuff like when I wrote when I was a kid, it was not completely \u201c my country, right or wrong.\u201d It was close to it. We\u2019re coming out of the Second World War. We still have that gung- ho. Even when [ 00: 10: 00] you take Korea, there was still that we- were- defending- the- world- for- democracy- type of\u2014 that\u2019s World War I, that\u2019s Wilsonian. But you know, there was still this\u2014 you sort of did what you did. I know guys who were in World War II, fought in these big battles and things like that. I never did anything like that. That was what you did. And I got this thing that I want to check on, the colonel that wrote the letter of commendation on me, and he\u2019s known as Standing- Dan- the- Ring- Mountain Man, and the way I gather it, in Korea he was commander of the Seventh Cav[ alry]. Do you know anything about the Korean War? A little bit. OK, the North Koreans attacked South Korea. That much I know. American forces from Japan rush into Pusan and establish what\u2019s known as the Pusan Perimeter. This was the Seventh Cav. They were completely outmanned; I mean this was, hey, get over there. It\u2019s June 2, get over there February the\u2014 two weeks, they get them up from Japan and send them over. And they broke out of the Pusan Perimeter. And I want to think that\u2019s where the Dan- the- Ring- Mountain Man, the way I understand, he got in the Ring Mountain with a Jeep and said, Follow me, men. And they broke out of there. About the same time, [ General Douglas] MacArthur\u2019s coming over the Inchon [ River] on the other side of the peninsula and they put the pincers on the Koreans and they drove them all the way up to the 38th Parallel. The question is, UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 37 do we go into China? And about that time, China comes in and pushes us back to the 38th Parallel, and then we have the armistice. That is a simplified, very quick, one- minute description of the Korean War. Now, go read the book and you\u2019ll learn a lot more. So I want to think that that\u2019s where that was. I know he was a hero in the Korean War. I know he was Eisenhower\u2019s\u2014 he was the guy that wrote the orders for D- Day. He was SHAEF, Strategic Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, which is Normandy. And he was the guy that wrote the orders. Eisenhower gave them; he wrote them. Somebody\u2019s got to do it. It\u2019s a good team. Well, if you look in those letters, he keeps on saying, If you\u2019re coming to Washington\u2014. I saw that. You know what he was talking about introducing me to, don\u2019t you? Who was the president? Get you a good job. I was busy going to law school. Now, maybe I should\u2019ve. I could\u2019ve become a big Republican and become a neo- conservative or something and been\u2014 no, I\u2019m just joking. I say that. But you know, I do respect Eisenhowerbecause he\u2019s the guy that said beware of the military- industrial complex, and I do respect\u2014 Yes. He had some good foresight. He had some good foresight. And he was a good man, but he was not\u2014 and got pushed around a little bit by the military- industrial complex. That\u2019s why beware. Yeah, beware. So, go ahead. I\u2019m sorry I got you strung off on something else. No, that\u2019s fine. No, it\u2019s all part of the story. So you\u2019re out there through October, you say? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 38 Yeah, beginning of October. I don\u2019t remember the exact date. I know it was football season. I got up at six. I left here at one o\u2019clock in the afternoon. I wanted to get back to Columbia [ Missouri] for a football game on Saturday. And I drove from here nonstop to Dodge City, Kansas, which is 1,200 miles, twenty- four hours. In those days, 50 miles an hour was going. Twenty- four hours flat. I stopped about one or two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, went to bed, got up at midnight, drove to Columbia, and went to the football game that afternoon. You had a goal. I was twenty- three years old. I had a goal. But I remember getting to Columbia about three in the morning, and then going to the football game, and then driving home. Now, did you choose to leave? Were you just done? Was your time at the test site only like\u2014? If you look at it, [ Operation] Plumbbob was over. OK. So you were just out there for Plumbbob. Yes. We closed everything up. I\u2019m sure if you look at the records, everything\u2019s going to be closed up about that time. I don\u2019t think I was the last guy out but, you know. I\u2019m sure there [ 00: 15: 00] were other guys. I mean the theater was not the end- all of what they were\u2014 I\u2019m sure there was other equipment people. You had also asked me about the racial makeup. Yeah. Yeah. Basically we had a black transportation unit. That\u2019s why we gave them \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd 52 Chevrolets rather than\u2014 now, it\u2019s not nice to say, but you know. But yes, we had the \u2019 52 Chevrolets because we were in the middle of the desert. But they drove all the trucks. They drove the buses, you know. I had one sergeant of mine was a black guy who had been a RIF- ed major. Reduction in force. Remember, we\u2019re right after Korea. So they had all these guys who were permanent- ranked UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 39 sergeants who then were upped to officers because they had to beef up the Army to go in Korea, and here they are, they\u2019re reduced back. What do you do? Yeah. Yeah, and these two guys\u2014 one guy was white, one guy was black\u2014 were majors, and they had been at Fort Ord, Camp Ord, in California, and they wanted to get them out of there, and then they had the option whether they wanted to stay in the military as a sergeant and be transferred elsewhere. But they had to have a safe place to put them. So, I\u2019ll be very frank, I was a little shavetail second lieutenant. They were majors. As far as I was concerned, these guys knew more about the Army than I did. I just left them alone. That\u2019s why I probably don\u2019t remember their names. I remember Bob Little\u2019s name, because he was with me from the beginning. And I remember Franklin Delano Farley\u2019s [ sp] name, who was a private who couldn\u2019t get in the Army now because he was borderline retarded. And I was on every board, and they were going to 208 Farley out of the service, unfit. And there was somebody that was in his command that didn\u2019t understand. And I remember, I was on the board and I said, Give him to me. He\u2019s only got like three or four months to go. I\u2019ll have him sweep up the theater. I\u2019ll give him things he can do. And I remember Bob Little and myself, we got him through, taking him down to the bus terminal and sending him back to Minnesota with written instructions where he changed the bus. And we got him out. And we got him an honorable discharge. And he was very loyal. Because one day some guys from Fort Lewis come down and were standing in front of the theater and somebody comes up, and these are young guys joking, looks at me and said, Hey, you rotten son- of- a\u2014 you know. And Farley was going to take him on because he called me a son- of- a- bitch. We didn\u2019t mean anything or, you know, nobody was excited, but Farley was\u2014 I mean he was borderline. He didn\u2019t understand it. We had a dog UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 40 that we had picked up in the desert called Flicker, who lived in the theater. Flicker. Flick. Lived in the theater. And Farley took care of the dog. He slept in the theater. He swept the theater. He swept my office. Once a week on a Saturday when there was no traffic, we allowed him to drive my Jeep down to pick up the mail, which was the highlight of Farley\u2019s week. And he thought I was a genius because I knew he was born in 1936, because his name was Franklin Delano and it would\u2019ve been an election year, presidential candidate, and he said, How did you know that, Lieutenant? Like, you know, I was some kind of a brilliant\u2014[ and I said], Well, pretty obvious, Farley. But you know. But I mean my floor in my theater or my floor in my office sparkled. Because he knew enough to know we saved him. Know we saved him. You want to know about suicide? One suicide while we were out there, a captain, Finance. We talked about RIF. This wasn\u2019t\u2014 and I was on that board. I wound up in all that. Now that I think about that, they worked my butt off out there. And we looked at the finances. Everything was\u2014 his family, his wife and family were all intact. The only thing we could ever find, it\u2019s the day before he committed suicide, he had gotten a RIF notice. He was going back. And that Wednesday afternoon was R& R, rest and recreation. And we used to play bridge at the [ 00: 20: 00] Officers\u2019 Club, and one of the guys was a doctor, and he was in the group, and he was talking to the doctor about if you get shot in the head, you know, and how bad it\u2019d feel. The doctor said no, the way you could go right away is if the bullet goes right through your heart. And the next morning, Thursday morning\u2014 he was right. I heard the shot. I recall it. He\u2019d unbuttoned his shirt and he pulled it up, put his .45 in there, and put himself away. And we investigated it. We had one court- martial. A guy who stole the laundry money and went to Vegas. Got caught and he charged him and then they put him back in charge of the laundry money, and UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 41 guess what he did? He went AWOL [ absent without official leave]. So you used to have an officer that when he was\u2014 well, he was at Fort Ord, too, which he was going to go back for his court- martial at Fort Ord. And I was in charge of protecting his rights while we had him. That was me. And so he went back to Fort Ord, and in those days you could request any officer in the military to come defend you. So I get this thing, we\u2019re flying you over to Fort Ord to defend this guy. Flew into San Francisco to defend this guy in a court- martial. And I get over there and he said, Hi, Lieutenant, I want to plead guilty. I said, What the hell? You got me all the way over here. And he said, Well, you did a good job and I thought you needed a little vacation. So I wind up over there, and he\u2019s got two charges, a theft and an AWOL, which would\u2019ve been ten- and- a- half years and a dishonorable discharge. And I think I did my job because he got six months and a bad conduct discharge. And then I told him how, after he got out of the Army, to have the bad conduct discharge changed into a general discharge. But he was a hero in Korea. That was my theory. Well, first thing, I got the whole second part knocked out because I said, Who was the idiot that put him back in charge of the money? Starting your law training then, too. Yeah, that\u2019s the first case I ever defended. Pled him guilty. But everybody knew. I wasn\u2019t a lawyer, but everybody\u2014 You were just headed that way. Everybody knew what I was wanting to do. And so I wound up on all these stupid boards. Well, it sounds like you had a full\u2014 you were 110 percent involved. Oh, yeah, when I think of it, well, that one letter that I sent to my mother, not the one from the trench, the other one, it says, This is the first weekend I\u2019ve had off in, you know, UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 42 because I was doing things on the weekend. Let\u2019s be honest, I don\u2019t tell my mother everything because what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. I didn\u2019t tell her about drinking at the Sahara or anything of that nature, yeah. But basically, yes, you figure what I was doing. I mean in the evenings, what was going on? The theater. And the story of the theater I remember is we got the musical Oklahoma!, which I thought, oh great. They booed because they thought it was going to be a Western, and when he starts singing\u2014 Oh, no! That\u2019s right. That\u2019s funny. The troops didn\u2019t like it. I remember that because I sort of wondered what I had. I\u2019ve had this college class on the history of musical comedy. I got Oklahoma! But I wasn\u2019t the one they were playing it for. So I remember that vividly. These guys, they wanted their money back. [ They said], We didn\u2019t come to hear that gal sing. We wanted to see some gunfights. Yeah, so much for the musical. That\u2019s right. Which, of course, was, as we discussed yesterday, part of the reason. They wanted to see some gunfighting because we were out here in Nevada. Well, yeah, there\u2019s a whole attitude. Whole attitude. And a whole reputation. But I didn\u2019t. You gathered if I wanted the other thing, that I didn\u2019t really 100 percent have that attitude. I\u2019m the world\u2019s worst shot. I was in the Army and I never\u2014 the only reason I got a marksmanship medal is my Jeep driver pulled the target for me. He said, We take care of you, Lieutenant? I can\u2019t shoot and I still can\u2019t shoot worth a darn. But I have a [ 00: 25: 00] marksmanship medal. Joe Lapinski, my driver, took care of that at Fort Lewis. Well, it\u2019s good you\u2019ve never had to enter a competition or something. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 43 Well, I thank God I never had to\u2014 I don\u2019t know if I could kill anybody or not. I really don\u2019t. I have no idea. I don\u2019t think you know till you get there. I would think when my girls were small, to protect them, I\u2019d probably do it. But personally, could I? Probably not. I\u2019m the lawyer that got the death penalty, and the reason I got death penalty in a trial is because I didn\u2019t believe in it, and when I went to the jury I said, Here are your options. You can either give him life imprisonment or death, and I\u2019m not going to tell you which one to do. And they gave him death, and the only reason the guy wasn\u2019t killed was that was before the Supreme Court overturned it. And I was so happy when the guy wound up with life imprisonment because I was worried I was going to have to go to Jeff[ erson] City and watch the guy die. I really didn\u2019t want to do that. But could I try the case and get it? Yes. My job. Could I go with the bomb and do it? Yes. If I was embarking it, yes. That make sense? It does. I mean because you mentioned sort of a dichotomous resistance before. The ultimate dichotomy, yeah. Yeah. And I mean you seem to be a very gentle kind of person with a good, nonviolent attitude, yet\u2014 I think the two most important phrases in the English language are \u201c please\u201d and \u201c thank you.\u201d But yet, here you are out at the Nevada Test Site with the atomic bomb, which is possibly the most awesomely, staggeringly powerful\u2014 Remember my telling you, that\u2019s why you get it in context? Yeah. I mean that had to be very interesting for you. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 44 You know, and really as time went by, until I got back out here in February, this sort of fades into being a judge for thirty years and raising a family, all the things that have been important to me. Well, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s some, a part of your\u2014 You know I had to dig to find those things, don\u2019t you? They weren\u2019t just right there. They are now because I found them, yeah. Right. So that\u2019s interesting, revisiting that whole aspect, that whole era, I bet. Yeah. The era is a dichotomy. I talk about the era as a dichotomy. I said to you yesterday, so many things that we see today, the George Wilson saying what\u2019s good for General Motors is good for the country, the ultimate\u2014 if it\u2019s business and profit, it\u2019s the ultimate. OK. The realization of Eisenhower about the military- industrial complex. The running against Stevenson on the anti- intellectual. The Joe McCarthy. This comes in my time. Rock and roll comes in my time. Brown vs. the School Board [ Brown vs. Board of Education]. I start college in \u2019 52, Mizzou, not one black student. I graduated \u2019 56. Fifty- four is Brown\u2014 eleven out of 7,700. We really improved! OK? But hey, black people didn\u2019t go to school in those days. They were working for my dad\u2019s union. When I go back and I think when I was a little kid, my dad used to take me with him up in North St. Louis and we\u2019d go\u2014 I know, I\u2019m a great expert on barbeque because we\u2019d be taking checks like to\u2014 in black neighborhoods, which were completely safe, I\u2019m sorry, in those days, completely safe. And you\u2019d go into the alleys and these people would be selling barbeque out of their garages. So somebody says, You really know barbeque! I was a little kid. I was exposed to these things. I guess I was just\u2014 oh, my wife always says that\u2014 when I was a prosecutor, we had a sixteen- year- old girl that did not know what her father did for a living. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 45 Now, you remember, I\u2019m a prosecutor in \u2019 77 and \u2019 75, so my oldest daughter is five. All [ 00: 30: 00] right. And I always made up my mind when I grew up\u2014 Sixty- seven to seventy- five? Well, I was actually a prosecutor from \u2019 65 to \u2019 75, but they had a prosecutor \u2019 73, \u2019 74, \u2019 75. I was assistant before then. And I said my girls will always know what I do. Of course, I was in the paper a lot, too. And I used to take my kids out to the courtroom. I used to always joke. I said they were like the lawyers. They had their Crayons and sat at the counsel table. And my oldest daughter, when she was in kindergarten, they had J- words. You know, you had A- words and B- words and J- words, and she put a bunch of bars and she put a guy in black in back of a desk. And a teacher said, Kasey Curran, what are your J- words? And she said, Judge and jail. And the teacher said, Why? And she said, My daddy\u2019s a judge and he sends people to jail. And the teacher said, What does a judge do? She\u2019s five. And she looked at her and she said, When people can\u2019t make up their minds, they come to him and he makes up their minds for them. That is a good answer. I remember that to this day because that\u2019s what I do. The five- year- old was right. But you knew she had some insight or whatever for doing it. And I\u2019ve always believed that because, you know, they needed to know who I was and who they were and where they were coming from. Now, did you ever talk to them about your days out in the test site? I doubt it. I mean I probably mentioned it, but as I said, when this all came up, most of this stuff was buried. I had to dig to find\u2014 I had to go through boxes to find some of this stuff. And of course my big find was the letter. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 46 Yes, well, that\u2019s a great find. It was a great find, and as a history major I think that\u2019s a great find. And somehow I\u2019m going to make sure it winds up over at this\u2014 Oh, they could definitely use a copy. I think that when they\u2019re talking about the soldiers out there, that is it. Well, that\u2019s the ultimate first- hand experience. That\u2019s it. This old man remembers what happened forty- eight years ago. That young kid was right there. I always come with these little conclusions, don\u2019t I? You can tell I\u2019m a speaker. The young kid lived it and he knew it. There\u2019s no history or glamorization, although it is pretty definitive. And at the time I think it was pretty glamorous. Well, my wife said, You wrote better then than you do now. Well, you\u2019re in the moment, too, you know, a lot of stuff going on. Yeah. But you read some of my stuff I did write\u2014 Well, you\u2019re a very good writer. At that time. Well, my sister\u2019s an English teacher and my brother was the chief technical writer for Martin Marietta Corporation. My wife was a business and English teacher. My daughters are a book editor, a lawyer, and paralegal. Do you want to play Wheel of Fortune in our house? It\u2019s like vicious. First one that knows the answer just yells it out and ruins it for everybody else. We call it Full Contact Wheel of Fortune. My middle daughter makes us all look bad. You put up two letters and she says, you know. I think I\u2019m getting real good. So you\u2019ve had some practice. Yeah. Ah, go to hell. But yeah. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 47 So what did your family think about you being out at the test site, your mom, your dad, your sister\u2014? Well, you can tell [ by] the tenor of the letters that they were worried. They were scared. They were worried. Because I\u2019m trying to tell them in the one letter, that part of it which was the trench part is over. We\u2019re going to be fifteen ( we weren\u2019t fifteen, we were about ten miles) but we\u2019re going to be fifteen miles back, so there\u2019s nothing to worry about. And, you know, that\u2019s a little bravado. Sure. And you don\u2019t want them to worry. Yeah, you don\u2019t want them to worry. But the little bravado is to make them not worry. Yeah, but [ 00: 35: 00] like, hey, I\u2019m fifteen miles back, no big deal. But if you read the letter, this was\u2014 because I\u2019ve read all this stuff trying to say, where was I? What was I doing? I was in a hurry, if you read from that letter, to get out of the Army because I wanted to go to law school. That\u2019s what you were saying. I\u2019m one of the few people that you know that at age five wanted to be like a lawyer, and did it, and at age seventy- one still loves it and still cares about it. It\u2019s great. You have a passion. So as soon as you got out of the military\u2014 well, you were in the military for a while, but after you left the test site is when you went back to law school. No. I go to Fort Lewis from October till the next April. And I get back up to the Fourth Infantry Division and the colonel says, Oh, I see you\u2019re a Special Forces lieutenant. We want to beat the Twelfth Infantry Division, which I referred to, too, being down there, in some sport. Would you take over as the athletics and recreation officer for the Fourth Infantry Division and see if you can do that? And he said, You\u2019ve got all the backing I [ you] want. So I did that, and I boxed. I got to the UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 48 finals of the Sixth Army tournament, 112- pound class. Hey. Got knocked out in that. But I got that far. I got that far. So I found a sergeant who was a professional boxer and we trained the boxing team and we beat the Twelfth Infantry. It all came down to basketball. The Twelfth Infantry had a guy by the name of Roger Byrd who was an All- American out of Kentucky, and another All- American out of the University of San Francisco, who was a black guy, by the way. The other guy was a white guy. He was a black guy. It only becomes important later when I tell you who he was. Yeah, he was coaching that team and I was coaching our team. And we had a guy by the name of Bruce Palmer who was a lieutenant and became one of the first black generals in the Army. And Bruce was a great basketball player. He was about six- three. But he wouldn\u2019t play because he was\u2014 we got him to play one game. We beat the Twelfth, I think it was 45- 42, and Bruce had forty- three points. He played in one game. The next time I coached a team, it was my daughter\u2019s eighth- grade Sacred Heart team. The next time the other guy coached a team, it was the Boston Celtics, because his name was K. C. Jones, The K. C. Jones, All- American, nice guy, really nice guy. But I beat him and then I got the eighth- grade team and he got the pro team. Yeah. But it couldn\u2019t have had anything to do with\u2014 my coaching was give the ball to Bruce. Yeah. Well, you know, if you got a strategy that works, go with it. It worked. But anyhow, the colonel was thrilled to death. They beat the Twelfth Infantry. And then April, I\u2014 actually, it wasn\u2019t quite two years, I got out early because I wanted to get back and file for state representative, which I did, and I got beat. You know, because my dad was dead and I was not, I was only twenty- four. People would look at me and say, You\u2019re too damn young. But you had high aspirations. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 49 Yeah, and there was a lot of that politically. Later on I became the state vice- president of the Young Democrats. I was about thirty- three, thirty- four. My good friend who we went to college together and to this day have lunch at least once a month, he was the president of the state Young Democrats and everything, and he\u2019s a lawyer, too, and we\u2019ve been friends forever and a day. And he got to name\u2014 and the key thing is I had that program and I was the chairman of the convention. He nominated the chairman of the convention. Then the guy who was the Young Democrat of the Year was a fellow by the name of Mel Carnahan, who was the governor of the State of Missouri, who was running against [ Senator John] Ashcroft and was killed in the plane crash. Right. Yeah. And still won. And still won. And I mean that was my good friend. Really. My wife was out of town. She called me up and said, Are you OK? Because that was somebody I knew really well. But you know, it\u2019s sort of funny because I showed her the book and I said, Here\u2019s a picture of me, and in \u2019 68 I didn\u2019t win the election for state representative and Mel did. Wonder where our paths would\u2019ve gone. Yeah, no kidding. And I wouldn\u2019t have gotten married if I\u2019d won that, because that\u2019s when I met my wife. And your wife\u2019s name is? [ 00: 40: 00] Mary. I would\u2019ve never called her back if I\u2019d have won that election. I\u2019d have been the hotshot up in the state. Nearly pulled it off but didn\u2019t quite. Didn\u2019t quite. Then every time I ever ran as prosecutor or judge, I won all the time. I\u2019ve won like ten elections, so I\u2019ve been through\u2014 UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 50 Interesting how things work. And where were you determined or designed to do or what are\u2014? How are the big things? My three daughters. Somebody\u2019s going to do something of some consequence? Don\u2019t know. What are you designed to do? I was always joking. There was a little girl that ran track for us who got in trouble one time. She was a white girl who was dating a black boy, and a girl yelled at her, and anyhow she took her on. And the principal, who had no sense at all, suspended her for the rest of the track meet. And Amy came crying to me and says, What do I do? What do I do, Mr. Curran? It wasn\u2019t \u201c Judge,\u201d it was \u201c Mr. Curran.\u201d And I said, Amy, we go out here on Good Friday and you run this two- mile like you\u2019ve never run it. Get mad. Get mad, Amy. And so she did, and then she wound up second in the state. She ran it. Anyhow, the thing was, my daughter really was the one who\u2014 Beth, my lawyer daughter, picked her up as a freshman \u2013 Beth was a junior \u2013 and I mean Amy was arrested for smoking pot and all this kind of stuff. The girl had scoliosis and asthma, you know, I mean\u2014 Beth said, Dad, she can run. Dad, she can run. Anyhow, so she\u2019s a coach today. But she\u2019s also a paramedic. And I said, You know, Amy could\u2019ve been in jail, but she\u2019s a paramedic. And was it that time where I said, You don\u2019t care if you are, you know, illegitimum non factum est, which means \u201c Don\u2019t let the bastards grind you down.\u201d And I said, Amy, that means you are your own person. You make your own decisions. You don\u2019t let the principal of the high school or that girl call you names. You don\u2019t let that bother you. You\u2019re Amy. So Amy someday may save somebody on the road. Who knows? And she\u2019s a teacher. Yeah, I mean that\u2019s just a great example of you just don\u2019t know where the paths are going to go or what to do. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 51 Everybody you run into in this world, you influence them in some way. It can be bad. It can be good. It can be indifferent. But you try to do it the good way. You know I\u2019m trying to influence you, don\u2019t you? I think so. I think your potential, you\u2019re going to be a doctorate, you\u2019re probably going to be a teacher, I imagine. Probably so. And so all this goes. Everything you do. I could\u2019ve been mean to you but I wouldn\u2019t. Well, I appreciate that. No, you know I\u2019m kidding. No, I\u2019m kidding. Well, listen, we\u2019re just about 12: 15 or so and I think we were going to do lunch at 12: 30, so why don\u2019t we break here? Have I tired you out especially? No, but I\u2019m going to break here. Are you learning anything? Oh, yes, I\u2019ve learned quite a bit. [ 0: 43: 47] End Track 2, Disc 2. [ End of interview]",

The goal is to create an archive which adds relevant material to the existing historical record. Oral history recordings and transcripts are primary source material and do not represent the final, verified, or complete narrative of the events under discussion. Rather, oral history is a spoken remembrance or dialogue, reflecting the interviewee\u2019s memories, points of view and personal opinions about events in response to the interviewer\u2019s specific questions. Oral history interviews document each interviewee\u2019s personal engagement with the history in question. They are unique records, reflecting the particular meaning the interviewee draws from her/ his individual life experience. Produced by: The Nevada Test Site Oral History Project Departments of History and Sociology University of Nevada, Las Vegas, 89154- 5020 Director and Editor Mary Palevsky Principal Investigators Robert Futrell, Dept. of Sociology Andrew Kirk, Dept. of History The material in the Nevada Test Site Oral History Project archive is based upon work supported by the U.

Drafting young men for military service was being talked about though I can\u2019t remember when this was actually activated. I had always liked school, made excellent grades, and it was taken for granted that I\u2019d go to college. But during my senior year I became very unsure about this; partly because of the general uncertainty of the times, partly because I was in love (I thought) but not quite ready for marriage, partly because of those economic values. I had seen how my parents had sacrificed to send my brother to Purdue during the depths of the depression (and he had a scholarship, too). My sister took a year\u2019s business course in Cincinnati and got a job in a bank, marrying soon after that. I finally decided to go to a teachers\u2019 college near Indianapolis\u2014 my parents had met there and it was dear to their hearts. For me, I guess it was the line of least resistance; I didn\u2019t want to be a teacher but could get a scholarship and take what was called a \u201c Commerce\u201d course which would, I thought, allow me to achieve independence and get out in the big wide world. There was, you know, this sense of immediacy\u2014 the world was crumbling about us and we wanted to live life to the hilt. (Sound familiar?) I was just finishing my third term (one year) at Central Normal College when Pearl Harbor occurred. By this time my father had been called back into the army and was stationed in Indianapolis. I decided I wanted to quit school and get a job, so I worked for awhile for a printing company in Indianapolis as a steno/ bookkeeper/ clerk with the magnificent salary of $ 15 a week. I\u2019d taken a Civil Service test for a CAF rating (clerical/ administrative/ fiscal) while at CNC, and soon received a job offer at the Wabash River Ordnance Works, a facility which the government was building near Terre Haute, IN. And at this time, I married my high school sweetheart, Alex (we were both 19) and we both worked at the ordnance works for a few UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 3 months, went to Austin, TX, where my brother was working, and lived there for a time, then my husband was drafted, all this within the space of less than a year. After a few weeks of basic training, Alex was sent to Ireland, then England, later France. Daddy was then stationed at an Induction Center in Fort Thomas, KY, just across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, and I went to live with them. All during the war I worked in Cincinnati for the (then) Army Air Force\u2014 the Ferrying Division of the Air Transport Command\u2014 as secretary to the Inspector General. This was a period of my life which affected me probably more than any previously. From a small town to a city with a vibrant culture, meeting many new and interesting people and encountering so many new ideas; and then of course the conflicts and doubts and uncertainties for what the future held. Then came V- E Day in June of 1945, and in August the news of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the awesome weapon which ended the war in Japan. I had had an inkling about the possibility of such a bomb (but not where it was being developed) from my brother, who had introduced me to science fiction way back when I was a child. I had read a fair amount, in such magazines as Astounding Science Fiction, and Bob told me about the incident when that magazine had planned to publish a story about nuclear fission, and the government had interceded to have it squelched. I suppose a lot of people knew about the possibility of such enormous amount of energy being released, but few about what was really being accomplished. At any rate, our first reaction on hearing about the atomic bombs being dropped on Japan was jubilation that the war was over, then horror as we saw pictures of the devastation, but still the war\u2019s end seemed to justify it. Many of my friends and relatives had husbands or boyfriends in the Pacific\u2014 and of course Alex might have been sent there, too, after V- E Day\u2014 so the good news prevailed. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 4 When Alex came home in early 1946, after almost three years of being apart, we were together for a year or so (living in Indianapolis), but couldn\u2019t seem to make it work so we finally called it a day. I went briefly to stay with my brother and his wife and their two small children in New York, just to try to sort out where I was going next. Westward Ho At that time my brother Bob, an electrical engineer, was working for a construction company which had a contract at Los Alamos, and he decided to go there to work. He flew out to see about housing and I drove out with my sister- in- law and the two babies, since I was at loose ends and could help a little. When we arrived it seemed like a very interesting place, so I put in my application at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, just as sort of an ace in the hole. Working at Los Alamos required me to get a Q- clearance, which took some time to process. I had always wanted to see San Francisco, and since the Q- clearance would take a few weeks anyway, I went on out to that fascinating city. I loved it there, got a government job (fairly easy, then, with a civil service rating) in the Labor Department but was just making a pittance and living was expensive. So when I got a letter advising me that my clearance had come through and offering me a job at LASL, I came back since I could live more reasonably there, although my brother and family were just about to move on to another job. This was in 1948. (Bob later worked at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and later still at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where he was involved in some very interesting things.) Los Alamos, New Mexico UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 5 The West in general, and this area in particular, were a revelation. My first impressions were the vastness, the difference in the countryside, the geography. The mountains were so high and so different from what I had pictured. Those I\u2019d seen in the East were gentle, rolling hills compared to these. I just couldn\u2019t believe the Sangre de Cristos. Another delight was the blue sky (city skies in Midwest winters seemed eternally leaden, particularly with all the soot from the soft coal that was burned at that time). The West was so beautiful and clean and lovely, a new world. As I became more familiar with my surroundings, I came to appreciate more and more the rich history of New Mexico, the Indian pueblos, the Spanish influence, the present day culture. It was and is fascinating, and I learned so much. I lived in a dorm room at first, later on it was a kitchenette apartment, and then the ultimate (for my job level)\u2014 an Iris Street Apartment. (Incidentally, the graduate student apartments here at UC San Diego are identical to those, at least from the outside. Of course, the Lab was run by the University of California.) This wasn\u2019t really discrimination, at least to my mind. None of the housing was very grand. There are stories about the early days at Los Alamos, when the houses on Bathtub Row were the greatest because they had bathtubs and all the others just showers. Santa Fe was just an hour away, and we\u2019d go down whenever possible. It was a wonderful city, with all that history. And the shops\u2014 art of all kinds, jewelry, ceramics, all those Indian treasures, clothing\u2014 what a lure they were. La Fonda (the hotel then). Fiesta time, when they burn Zozobra, Old Man Gloom. Restaurants with fascinating food. (Los Alamos maybe had one dress shop, a movie theatre, a cafeteria, drug store, etc.) Visits to the Indian pueblos, their dances, trips to Taos, Bandelier National Monument. Land of Enchantment, indeed. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 6 Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL) \u2013 now Los Alamos National Lab I was hired as a secretary/ typist for what was supposed to be a temporary assignment to J- Division, to type reports of the just completed Operation Sandstone at Enewetak. (In those days spelled \u201c Eniwetok.\u201d) After the reports were done, I was supposed to go to another Division. J- Division had been formed as a temporary entity to carry out the Sandstone Operation in the Spring of 1948, and was to be disbanded after the reports were done, with its members going back to their original divisions in the Lab. Dr. Darol Froman, who had been the Test Director for Sandstone, was Division Leader, Dr. Alvin C. Graves his Assistant Division Leader. When I started working there the scientists were just trickling home from the Pacific. Then the decision was made to continue testing, planning was started for Operation Greenhouse (also to be at Enewetak) in 1951, and J- Division became a permanent division. Darol went back to P- Division (and later to the Director\u2019s Office under Norris Bradbury), and Al became Division Leader. A revelation from the very beginning was the democracy of the place, with everyone addressed by his first name (no titles) from top scientists on down. Quite a contrast from the formality I had been used to in my former jobs, particularly with the military. My first boss was Dr. John C. Clark (Jack), a physicist who was working on the planning for the next test. Jack was affectionately known as \u201c The Mayor of Eniwetok.\u201d I\u2019ll never forget all those map cases in his office, filled with USGS maps of atolls in the Pacific. In addition to secretarial work, several of us were typing the reports, editing and proofreading them as we went along. Mine was for the Blast Effects experiments performed by Drs. Greg Hartmann and Curt Lampson of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 7 I\u2019d like to mention some of my co- workers in the early days. Mary Monk, Al Graves\u2019 secretary, was a treasure. She supervised us, helped with editing, and in general smoothed our paths. Another friend was Jan Morse (now Betts), who was hired at the same time as I was and who became Al\u2019s secretary after Mary left. Then there was lovely Elise, who also supervised and helped us; a real dear, she always reminded me of Tenniel\u2019s illustration of Alice in Wonderland. And Betty Sexton, who helped me proofread the Blasted(ed) Report and whose sense of humor brightened many a day. Later there were Dorothy Frenz (now Jones), who worked with another division involved in test work, and Lee Hasse (now Felt), who later worked for Jack Clark. I still keep in touch with the latter two. And so many more\u2014 J- Division was always made up of such dandy people, even as it grew and grew. As our current work increased the reports got relegated to evenings and weekends, but they were finally finished. And partly because I could take fairly good shorthand to record meetings, I was assigned to Group J- 7. My first boss was Dr. Frederick (Fred) Reines, a brilliant theoretical physicist who later won the Nobel Prize for his work on neutrinos. Group J- 7\u2019 s members played dual roles in that group and other divisions of the Lab and were concerned with planning the specific diagnostic and effects tests, supervising and maintaining liaison with the subcontractors who performed them, and in some cases conducting experiments themselves. The group also included several members of the military who were involved in the experimental work. Some other names of interest: Fred, as noted, from T- Division; Bill Ogle from P- Division, Physics; Wright Langham from Health; Les Seely from GMX; Berlyn Brixner from M- 8, Optics; Bob Watt, Dave Hall and John Malik also from P- Division, I believe; Jerry Suydam from T- Division. There were also Gaelen Felt, who headed another J- Group; Herman Hoerlin, UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 8 concerned with photography; and later Lee Aamodt and Al Embry, administrative and logistic. Working closely with J- 7 were Rod Spence from Radiological Chemistry and Clyde Cowan who worked on electromagnetic effects and neutrons. Some of our military members from various units with acronyms like AFSWP (Armed Forces Special Weapons Project): Ed Zadina (Army; concerned with blast effects); \u201c Rojo\u201d Adamson (Navy); Paul Galentine (Air Force, I believe); Dick Houghton. At some point Fred wanted to devote more time to his T- Division work, and Dr. William (Bill) Ogle became Group Leader. He was from P- Division, as noted, had done neutron experiments on Sandstone, and had been in J- 7 since its inception. The interplay between him and Fred was truly remarkable. I can\u2019t express how much I admired them both, as well as the others of the group who all worked so well together. Bill was absolutely tops as a boss, a great mind along with a terrific sense of humor. Fred was also no slouch in that department. They are both dead now. I did secretarial work for everyone in the group, with some very helpful assistance\u2014 first \u201c Tiny,\u201d then Lee Klein, formerly a WAC on the Hill [ Los Alamos] in the early days who had been one of Oppenheimer\u2019s drivers and still worshipped \u201c Oppie.\u201d Later there were also an Air Force Sergeant, Marvin Smith (Smitty), and Navy Noncom, Joe Valles, who did clerical work, especially for our military members. Somewhere along the line we adopted the Walt Kelly comic strip figure Pogo as our logo, and became the Pogo Staff. Dave Self, who worked down the hall for Bob Campbell in Engineering and Drafting and was doing the drawings and equations for the reports, introduced UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 9 me to the strip which was running in the Albuquerque Journal; I pinned it up on the bulletin board, and we were hooked. With regard to trying to understand the work there without a scientific background: of course at first it was just Greek to me, although by that time I knew a little bit about the work there. But it becomes easier as you go along, and you at least learn to spell the words, or where to look them up. (And people were kind! I can still remember my embarrassment after typing a letter for Les Seely full of references to \u201c doors\u201d instead of \u201c Dewars.\u201d He actually apologized, saying he had a cold and hadn\u2019t enunciated clearly, bless him.) A very nice lady physicist, Lucille, gave us (the clerical help) classes in what she called \u201c Conversational Physics.\u201d And we could attend the weekly seminars where the Lab\u2019s work was discussed. For Math, I had studied only Algebra and Plane Geometry in High School, and Biology for my Science. (Chemistry wasn\u2019t offered, my father taught Physics, and while he was a great teacher, you know how it is with kids.) So I knew very little about these subjects. Later at Los Alamos I took Beginning Physics and Chemistry classes which were taught at night by members of the Lab as UC extension courses, and a couple of math classes given as extension courses on the Hill by the University of New Mexico. Then during Operation Castle in 1954, most of the Group\u2019s scientists were overseas so I took a leave of absence and enrolled for a semester at the University of California in Berkeley. I was going to study all these things\u2014 Physics, Chemistry, Math, etc.\u2014 but then at the end of the year Herb [ Grier] and I got married and there went my career as Madame Curie. I should confess that taking notes in the J- 7 meetings each week, as well as some others on occasion, was a real challenge. I wasn\u2019t really that swift and half the time was out of my depth, but somehow Fred and later Bill always managed to take my mangled scraps and make UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 10 readable and informative reports out of them. One of the most interesting was in August of 1950, during which conducting continental tests in Nevada was discussed, although I surely didn\u2019t realize all the implications for the future. [ LASL Report LAMS- 1173, dtd 1 Sep 50, \u201c Discussions of Radiological Hazards Associated with a Continental Test Site for Atomic Bombs,\u201d based on Notes of Meetings held at Los Alamos 1 Aug 50, by Frederick Reines.] Actually, the things I remember most about that meeting are first, of course, the importance of all the participants, and then the talk about the prevailing winds (a primary factor because of fall- out)\u2014 and a meteorologist patiently explaining to someone that a northwesterly wind was from the northwest. These were some of the most exciting and fulfilling times of my life. I worked with brilliant, stimulating people who were also just super individuals. My only complaint was that I couldn\u2019t go to Enewetak (no facilities for women). How jealous I was of Smitty when he came back from Operation Ivy crowing, \u201c I saw Mike!\u201d So it was a great day when I learned I was one of the two women picked to go to the test site in Nevada (then called Nevada Proving Ground) as clerical workers for Operation Ranger, the first continental tests since Trinity. The other girl was Mary Minshall, who worked for Armand Kelly in J- l, Administration. Nevada Test Site We went out for Ranger in January of 1951. Again I worked for Jack Clark, as he was the Test Director, but Fred and Bill were also there as well as others of the group, including Smitty and Joe Valles. I did work for anyone who needed dictation and typing. It was indeed an exciting time (what an understatement!). Camp Mercury was not there yet, so we just stayed at the Control Point, which was near Frenchman\u2019s Flat, up to and during the shots. These were air UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 11 drops, the plane (\u201c Bullpup\u201d) coming from Kirtland Field in Albuquerque. When a shot was over we\u2019d go back to Las Vegas. We stayed at the Hotel Last Frontier, which is no longer there. I guess this is when I really came to know Herb Grier, my future husband. I had met him in 1948\u2014 he was one of the experimenters coming back from Sandstone that summer, and often came out from Boston during the planning for Greenhouse. But he was just someone who came into the office and seemed very gentlemanly and polite; I had typed a letter or two for him but that\u2019s all. Out in the CP, seeing the interactions among him and others, I became better acquainted with him as a person. Las Vegas, in those days, had just begun to grow. El Rancho Vegas, the first hotel on the Strip, was there, as were the Desert Inn, Thunderbird, Sahara, Flamingo\u2014 I remember seeing the Sands during construction either later that year or the next. Bill Ogle was a native of Las Vegas\u2014 his father was an engineer on the railroad\u2014 he grew up there and remembered when the whole town would go on a picnic in a park down on North Las Vegas Boulevard. I found it completely fascinating, of course. When we came in from the site\u2014 we\u2019d have been up all day and the shots were like three or four in the morning\u2014 we\u2019d go sleepily through the casino to our hotel rooms and all those people would be standing around gambling. It was so amazing, so different from Los Alamos. I should mention that our per diem was six dollars a day for a hotel room (nice ones, too!) and the food on a comparable scale. Remember, that was 1951. There were five air drops on Ranger. For me the most exciting one of all was of course the first shot. I had seen numberless pictures of the fireball going up, but just to be there\u2014 there\u2019s the countdown\u2014 on these shots we went outside the CP to watch, were told to put on dark glasses or face away from the blast. And then comes this awesome, indescribable sight, and later you feel the shock wave. And your heart starts beating again after awhile. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 12 The Control Point for Ranger was a temporary one. Later a heavily reinforced concrete building was erected overlooking Yucca Flat. Another exciting time was when a shot was aborted and the plane had to turn around and go back to Kirtland Field. One of our Group members, Gaelen Felt, was riding in the plane on that trip. Still another was on a later operation, where 300- ft towers were employed to hold the gadget, which was armed before the shot by EG Herb went to the Manhattan District and Germeshausen to the MIT Radiation Lab. Doc was also doing work connected with the war; he and Herb did some things together, including night aerial photography. Herb\u2019s chief contribution initially was the design and development of the firing sets for the Fat Man device. How Barney O\u2019Keefe became involved with EG witness his famous UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 15 \u201c Ivy Tower\u201d photograph which caught the device at an unbelievably early stage in detonation.) But he had so many other interests as well\u2014 underwater photography and diving with Costeau in the Mediterranean, teaching undergraduates and graduate students at MIT, a host of things. He was one of the most delightful persons I have ever met. Just interested in everybody and everything\u2014 one of those people who make you feel worthwhile no matter how insignificant you might be. And a great inspiration to his students; at MIT they still worship his memory. His wife, Esther, was a dear, also. She outlived him for quite a long time, but died recently. Germeshausen (Herb called him \u201c Germs\u201d with a hard G, his wife Polly called him Ken) was an admirable person, too. A brilliant man, very reserved and quiet. Barney O\u2019Keefe was a dynamo, taking the company into commercial ventures and acquisitions. I have great admiration for all of them. As to our feelings about working in the field of nuclear development, I have already mentioned my reaction when the atomic bomb ended World War II. When I was at Los Alamos the Cold War was just developing, and many felt that we were saving the country (others, of course, the contrary). I don\u2019t think Herb felt a sense of guilt, he thought the work quite necessary and defensible. But that does not preclude the regret that we and most people felt, that such a terrible weapon was necessary in our supposedly enlightened civilization. I do still hope that we won\u2019t give up the quest for developing the concept for renewable energy\u2014 it could save our planet rather than destroy it\u2014 and someday power our spaceships to the stars. Return to the Pacific In 1989, Herb accompanied a group who had worked on the Pacific tests on a trip arranged by Los Alamos to Eniwetok and Bikini, where the natives had been allowed to return UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 16 after the government had restored those atolls to a habitable state. The US was, of course, concerned about how the people would adjust or adapt to going back. Herb thought that the US had done an excellent job of returning the islands to the way the natives wanted them. But he was disturbed by the fact that their lives did not seem to have much incentive, that it was essentially a welfare state. I\u2019d like to say a little here about Roger Ray, for whom Herb had so much admiration because of Roger\u2019s concern for the Marshallese. Roger was assigned to J- Division as an Army Major in 1953, and participated in several overseas operations thereafter. As I learned later (I quote from his e- mail of 8- 15- 05): \u201c My last military assignment was as Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy. Then came assignment as Operations Director of the Nevada Test Site, and then a second retirement. Somewhere in there I learned of efforts to re- settle the former inhabitants of Enewetak in their ancient home. It was my good fortune to have the opportunity to organize in behalf of both the Defense Dept and the Atomic Energy Commission, their efforts to rehabilitate this native homeland of a kind and gentle people who were so deserving.\u201d While he expresses frustration for \u201c having been less than a success in improving our official stewardship,\u201d he says, \u201c I have tried to at least leave a record for those who might at some time later pick up that challenge.\u201d Roger\u2019s story will be told elsewhere. It is an important part of our testing history. Las Vegas \u2013 La Jolla Herb and I lived in Las Vegas for 23 years, watching it grow and grow. EG wish now I\u2019d studied computers.) Since this was also a second marriage for Herb, I have two stepchildren, Joan who lives in San Luis Obispo, CA now, and Herb III who\u2019s in Parker, CO, near Denver. They have children, too, so I\u2019m blessed with five grandchildren (including David\u2019s two boys) and two great- grandchildren. We are all very close. In 1977 we moved to La Jolla, CA, and found much happiness in our new environment. Herb died in 1999. While a longstanding and increasingly debilitating peripheral neuropathy hampers my activities, I am fortunate to have excellent care and be able to enjoy friends, family and my garden. The recently opened Atomic Testing Museum in Las Vegas, made possible by so UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 18 many dedicated members of the Nevada Test Site Historical Foundation, has been a great source of stimulation, of making new acquaintances and renewing old ones, and reliving memories.

The goal is to create an archive which adds relevant material to the existing historical record. Oral history recordings and transcripts are primary source material and do not represent the final, verified, or complete narrative of the events under discussion. Rather, oral history is a spoken remembrance or dialogue, reflecting the interviewee\u2019s memories, points of view and personal opinions about events in response to the interviewer\u2019s specific questions. Oral history interviews document each interviewee\u2019s personal engagement with the history in question. They are unique records, reflecting the particular meaning the interviewee draws from her/ his individual life experience.

Drafting young men for military service was being talked about though I can\u2019t remember when this was actually activated. I had always liked school, made excellent grades, and it was taken for granted that I\u2019d go to college. But during my senior year I became very unsure about this; partly because of the general uncertainty of the times, partly because I was in love ( I thought) but not quite ready for marriage, partly because of those economic values. I had seen how my parents had sacrificed to send my brother to Purdue during the depths of the depression ( and he had a scholarship, too). My sister took a year\u2019s business course in Cincinnati and got a job in a bank, marrying soon after that. I finally decided to go to a teachers\u2019 college near Indianapolis\u2014 my parents had met there and it was dear to their hearts. For me, I guess it was the line of least resistance; I didn\u2019t want to be a teacher but could get a scholarship and take what was called a \u201c Commerce\u201d course which would, I thought, allow me to achieve independence and get out in the big wide world. There was, you know, this sense of immediacy\u2014 the world was crumbling about us and we wanted to live life to the hilt. ( Sound familiar?) I was just finishing my third term ( one year) at Central Normal College when Pearl Harbor occurred. By this time my father had been called back into the army and was stationed in Indianapolis. I decided I wanted to quit school and get a job, so I worked for awhile for a printing company in Indianapolis as a steno/ bookkeeper/ clerk with the magnificent salary of $ 15 a week. I\u2019d taken a Civil Service test for a CAF rating ( clerical/ administrative/ fiscal) while at CNC, and soon received a job offer at the Wabash River Ordnance Works, a facility which the government was building near Terre Haute, IN. And at this time, I married my high school sweetheart, Alex ( we were both 19) and we both worked at the ordnance works for a few UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 3 months, went to Austin, TX, where my brother was working, and lived there for a time, then my husband was drafted, all this within the space of less than a year. After a few weeks of basic training, Alex was sent to Ireland, then England, later France. Daddy was then stationed at an Induction Center in Fort Thomas, KY, just across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, and I went to live with them. All during the war I worked in Cincinnati for the ( then) Army Air Force\u2014 the Ferrying Division of the Air Transport Command\u2014 as secretary to the Inspector General. This was a period of my life which affected me probably more than any previously. From a small town to a city with a vibrant culture, meeting many new and interesting people and encountering so many new ideas; and then of course the conflicts and doubts and uncertainties for what the future held. Then came V- E Day in June of 1945, and in August the news of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the awesome weapon which ended the war in Japan. I had had an inkling about the possibility of such a bomb ( but not where it was being developed) from my brother, who had introduced me to science fiction way back when I was a child. I had read a fair amount, in such magazines as Astounding Science Fiction, and Bob told me about the incident when that magazine had planned to publish a story about nuclear fission, and the government had interceded to have it squelched. I suppose a lot of people knew about the possibility of such enormous amount of energy being released, but few about what was really being accomplished. At any rate, our first reaction on hearing about the atomic bombs being dropped on Japan was jubilation that the war was over, then horror as we saw pictures of the devastation, but still the war\u2019s end seemed to justify it. Many of my friends and relatives had husbands or boyfriends in the Pacific\u2014 and of course Alex might have been sent there, too, after V- E Day\u2014 so the good news prevailed. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 4 When Alex came home in early 1946, after almost three years of being apart, we were together for a year or so ( living in Indianapolis), but couldn\u2019t seem to make it work so we finally called it a day. I went briefly to stay with my brother and his wife and their two small children in New York, just to try to sort out where I was going next. Westward Ho At that time my brother Bob, an electrical engineer, was working for a construction company which had a contract at Los Alamos, and he decided to go there to work. He flew out to see about housing and I drove out with my sister- in- law and the two babies, since I was at loose ends and could help a little. When we arrived it seemed like a very interesting place, so I put in my application at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, just as sort of an ace in the hole. Working at Los Alamos required me to get a Q- clearance, which took some time to process. I had always wanted to see San Francisco, and since the Q- clearance would take a few weeks anyway, I went on out to that fascinating city. I loved it there, got a government job ( fairly easy, then, with a civil service rating) in the Labor Department but was just making a pittance and living was expensive. So when I got a letter advising me that my clearance had come through and offering me a job at LASL, I came back since I could live more reasonably there, although my brother and family were just about to move on to another job. This was in 1948. ( Bob later worked at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and later still at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where he was involved in some very interesting things.) Los Alamos, New Mexico UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 5 The West in general, and this area in particular, were a revelation. My first impressions were the vastness, the difference in the countryside, the geography. The mountains were so high and so different from what I had pictured. Those I\u2019d seen in the East were gentle, rolling hills compared to these. I just couldn\u2019t believe the Sangre de Cristos. Another delight was the blue sky ( city skies in Midwest winters seemed eternally leaden, particularly with all the soot from the soft coal that was burned at that time). The West was so beautiful and clean and lovely, a new world. As I became more familiar with my surroundings, I came to appreciate more and more the rich history of New Mexico, the Indian pueblos, the Spanish influence, the present day culture. It was and is fascinating, and I learned so much. I lived in a dorm room at first, later on it was a kitchenette apartment, and then the ultimate ( for my job level)\u2014 an Iris Street Apartment. ( Incidentally, the graduate student apartments here at UC San Diego are identical to those, at least from the outside. Of course, the Lab was run by the University of California.) This wasn\u2019t really discrimination, at least to my mind. None of the housing was very grand. There are stories about the early days at Los Alamos, when the houses on Bathtub Row were the greatest because they had bathtubs and all the others just showers. Santa Fe was just an hour away, and we\u2019d go down whenever possible. It was a wonderful city, with all that history. And the shops\u2014 art of all kinds, jewelry, ceramics, all those Indian treasures, clothing\u2014 what a lure they were. La Fonda ( the hotel then). Fiesta time, when they burn Zozobra, Old Man Gloom. Restaurants with fascinating food. ( Los Alamos maybe had one dress shop, a movie theatre, a cafeteria, drug store, etc.) Visits to the Indian pueblos, their dances, trips to Taos, Bandelier National Monument. Land of Enchantment, indeed. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 6 Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory ( LASL) \u2013 now Los Alamos National Lab I was hired as a secretary/ typist for what was supposed to be a temporary assignment to J- Division, to type reports of the just completed Operation Sandstone at Enewetak. ( In those days spelled \u201c Eniwetok.\u201d) After the reports were done, I was supposed to go to another Division. J- Division had been formed as a temporary entity to carry out the Sandstone Operation in the Spring of 1948, and was to be disbanded after the reports were done, with its members going back to their original divisions in the Lab. Dr. Darol Froman, who had been the Test Director for Sandstone, was Division Leader, Dr. Alvin C. Graves his Assistant Division Leader. When I started working there the scientists were just trickling home from the Pacific. Then the decision was made to continue testing, planning was started for Operation Greenhouse ( also to be at Enewetak) in 1951, and J- Division became a permanent division. Darol went back to P- Division ( and later to the Director\u2019s Office under Norris Bradbury), and Al became Division Leader. A revelation from the very beginning was the democracy of the place, with everyone addressed by his first name ( no titles) from top scientists on down. Quite a contrast from the formality I had been used to in my former jobs, particularly with the military. My first boss was Dr. John C. Clark ( Jack), a physicist who was working on the planning for the next test. Jack was affectionately known as \u201c The Mayor of Eniwetok.\u201d I\u2019ll never forget all those map cases in his office, filled with USGS maps of atolls in the Pacific. In addition to secretarial work, several of us were typing the reports, editing and proofreading them as we went along. Mine was for the Blast Effects experiments performed by Drs. Greg Hartmann and Curt Lampson of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 7 I\u2019d like to mention some of my co- workers in the early days. Mary Monk, Al Graves\u2019 secretary, was a treasure. She supervised us, helped with editing, and in general smoothed our paths. Another friend was Jan Morse ( now Betts), who was hired at the same time as I was and who became Al\u2019s secretary after Mary left. Then there was lovely Elise, who also supervised and helped us; a real dear, she always reminded me of Tenniel\u2019s illustration of Alice in Wonderland. And Betty Sexton, who helped me proofread the Blasted( ed) Report and whose sense of humor brightened many a day. Later there were Dorothy Frenz ( now Jones), who worked with another division involved in test work, and Lee Hasse ( now Felt), who later worked for Jack Clark. I still keep in touch with the latter two. And so many more\u2014 J- Division was always made up of such dandy people, even as it grew and grew. As our current work increased the reports got relegated to evenings and weekends, but they were finally finished. And partly because I could take fairly good shorthand to record meetings, I was assigned to Group J- 7. My first boss was Dr. Frederick ( Fred) Reines, a brilliant theoretical physicist who later won the Nobel Prize for his work on neutrinos. Group J- 7\u2019 s members played dual roles in that group and other divisions of the Lab and were concerned with planning the specific diagnostic and effects tests, supervising and maintaining liaison with the subcontractors who performed them, and in some cases conducting experiments themselves. The group also included several members of the military who were involved in the experimental work. Some other names of interest: Fred, as noted, from T- Division; Bill Ogle from P- Division, Physics; Wright Langham from Health; Les Seely from GMX; Berlyn Brixner from M- 8, Optics; Bob Watt, Dave Hall and John Malik also from P- Division, I believe; Jerry Suydam from T- Division. There were also Gaelen Felt, who headed another J- Group; Herman Hoerlin, UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 8 concerned with photography; and later Lee Aamodt and Al Embry, administrative and logistic. Working closely with J- 7 were Rod Spence from Radiological Chemistry and Clyde Cowan who worked on electromagnetic effects and neutrons. Some of our military members from various units with acronyms like AFSWP ( Armed Forces Special Weapons Project): Ed Zadina ( Army; concerned with blast effects); \u201c Rojo\u201d Adamson ( Navy); Paul Galentine ( Air Force, I believe); Dick Houghton. At some point Fred wanted to devote more time to his T- Division work, and Dr. William ( Bill) Ogle became Group Leader. He was from P- Division, as noted, had done neutron experiments on Sandstone, and had been in J- 7 since its inception. The interplay between him and Fred was truly remarkable. I can\u2019t express how much I admired them both, as well as the others of the group who all worked so well together. Bill was absolutely tops as a boss, a great mind along with a terrific sense of humor. Fred was also no slouch in that department. They are both dead now. I did secretarial work for everyone in the group, with some very helpful assistance\u2014 first \u201c Tiny,\u201d then Lee Klein, formerly a WAC on the Hill [ Los Alamos] in the early days who had been one of Oppenheimer\u2019s drivers and still worshipped \u201c Oppie.\u201d Later there were also an Air Force Sergeant, Marvin Smith ( Smitty), and Navy Noncom, Joe Valles, who did clerical work, especially for our military members. Somewhere along the line we adopted the Walt Kelly comic strip figure Pogo as our logo, and became the Pogo Staff. Dave Self, who worked down the hall for Bob Campbell in Engineering and Drafting and was doing the drawings and equations for the reports, introduced UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 9 me to the strip which was running in the Albuquerque Journal; I pinned it up on the bulletin board, and we were hooked. With regard to trying to understand the work there without a scientific background: of course at first it was just Greek to me, although by that time I knew a little bit about the work there. But it becomes easier as you go along, and you at least learn to spell the words, or where to look them up. ( And people were kind! I can still remember my embarrassment after typing a letter for Les Seely full of references to \u201c doors\u201d instead of \u201c Dewars.\u201d He actually apologized, saying he had a cold and hadn\u2019t enunciated clearly, bless him.) A very nice lady physicist, Lucille, gave us ( the clerical help) classes in what she called \u201c Conversational Physics.\u201d And we could attend the weekly seminars where the Lab\u2019s work was discussed. For Math, I had studied only Algebra and Plane Geometry in High School, and Biology for my Science. ( Chemistry wasn\u2019t offered, my father taught Physics, and while he was a great teacher, you know how it is with kids.) So I knew very little about these subjects. Later at Los Alamos I took Beginning Physics and Chemistry classes which were taught at night by members of the Lab as UC extension courses, and a couple of math classes given as extension courses on the Hill by the University of New Mexico. Then during Operation Castle in 1954, most of the Group\u2019s scientists were overseas so I took a leave of absence and enrolled for a semester at the University of California in Berkeley. I was going to study all these things\u2014 Physics, Chemistry, Math, etc.\u2014 but then at the end of the year Herb [ Grier] and I got married and there went my career as Madame Curie. I should confess that taking notes in the J- 7 meetings each week, as well as some others on occasion, was a real challenge. I wasn\u2019t really that swift and half the time was out of my depth, but somehow Fred and later Bill always managed to take my mangled scraps and make UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 10 readable and informative reports out of them. One of the most interesting was in August of 1950, during which conducting continental tests in Nevada was discussed, although I surely didn\u2019t realize all the implications for the future. [ LASL Report LAMS- 1173, dtd 1 Sep 50, \u201c Discussions of Radiological Hazards Associated with a Continental Test Site for Atomic Bombs,\u201d based on Notes of Meetings held at Los Alamos 1 Aug 50, by Frederick Reines.] Actually, the things I remember most about that meeting are first, of course, the importance of all the participants, and then the talk about the prevailing winds ( a primary factor because of fall- out)\u2014 and a meteorologist patiently explaining to someone that a northwesterly wind was from the northwest. These were some of the most exciting and fulfilling times of my life. I worked with brilliant, stimulating people who were also just super individuals. My only complaint was that I couldn\u2019t go to Enewetak ( no facilities for women). How jealous I was of Smitty when he came back from Operation Ivy crowing, \u201c I saw Mike!\u201d So it was a great day when I learned I was one of the two women picked to go to the test site in Nevada ( then called Nevada Proving Ground) as clerical workers for Operation Ranger, the first continental tests since Trinity. The other girl was Mary Minshall, who worked for Armand Kelly in J- l, Administration. Nevada Test Site We went out for Ranger in January of 1951. Again I worked for Jack Clark, as he was the Test Director, but Fred and Bill were also there as well as others of the group, including Smitty and Joe Valles. I did work for anyone who needed dictation and typing. It was indeed an exciting time ( what an understatement!). Camp Mercury was not there yet, so we just stayed at the Control Point, which was near Frenchman\u2019s Flat, up to and during the shots. These were air UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 11 drops, the plane (\u201c Bullpup\u201d) coming from Kirtland Field in Albuquerque. When a shot was over we\u2019d go back to Las Vegas. We stayed at the Hotel Last Frontier, which is no longer there. I guess this is when I really came to know Herb Grier, my future husband. I had met him in 1948\u2014 he was one of the experimenters coming back from Sandstone that summer, and often came out from Boston during the planning for Greenhouse. But he was just someone who came into the office and seemed very gentlemanly and polite; I had typed a letter or two for him but that\u2019s all. Out in the CP, seeing the interactions among him and others, I became better acquainted with him as a person. Las Vegas, in those days, had just begun to grow. El Rancho Vegas, the first hotel on the Strip, was there, as were the Desert Inn, Thunderbird, Sahara, Flamingo\u2014 I remember seeing the Sands during construction either later that year or the next. Bill Ogle was a native of Las Vegas\u2014 his father was an engineer on the railroad\u2014 he grew up there and remembered when the whole town would go on a picnic in a park down on North Las Vegas Boulevard. I found it completely fascinating, of course. When we came in from the site\u2014 we\u2019d have been up all day and the shots were like three or four in the morning\u2014 we\u2019d go sleepily through the casino to our hotel rooms and all those people would be standing around gambling. It was so amazing, so different from Los Alamos. I should mention that our per diem was six dollars a day for a hotel room ( nice ones, too!) and the food on a comparable scale. Remember, that was 1951. There were five air drops on Ranger. For me the most exciting one of all was of course the first shot. I had seen numberless pictures of the fireball going up, but just to be there\u2014 there\u2019s the countdown\u2014 on these shots we went outside the CP to watch, were told to put on dark glasses or face away from the blast. And then comes this awesome, indescribable sight, and later you feel the shock wave. And your heart starts beating again after awhile. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 12 The Control Point for Ranger was a temporary one. Later a heavily reinforced concrete building was erected overlooking Yucca Flat. Another exciting time was when a shot was aborted and the plane had to turn around and go back to Kirtland Field. One of our Group members, Gaelen Felt, was riding in the plane on that trip. Still another was on a later operation, where 300- ft towers were employed to hold the gadget, which was armed before the shot by EG Herb went to the Manhattan District and Germeshausen to the MIT Radiation Lab. Doc was also doing work connected with the war; he and Herb did some things together, including night aerial photography. Herb\u2019s chief contribution initially was the design and development of the firing sets for the Fat Man device. How Barney O\u2019Keefe became involved with EG witness his famous UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 15 \u201c Ivy Tower\u201d photograph which caught the device at an unbelievably early stage in detonation.) But he had so many other interests as well\u2014 underwater photography and diving with Costeau in the Mediterranean, teaching undergraduates and graduate students at MIT, a host of things. He was one of the most delightful persons I have ever met. Just interested in everybody and everything\u2014 one of those people who make you feel worthwhile no matter how insignificant you might be. And a great inspiration to his students; at MIT they still worship his memory. His wife, Esther, was a dear, also. She outlived him for quite a long time, but died recently. Germeshausen ( Herb called him \u201c Germs\u201d with a hard G, his wife Polly called him Ken) was an admirable person, too. A brilliant man, very reserved and quiet. Barney O\u2019Keefe was a dynamo, taking the company into commercial ventures and acquisitions. I have great admiration for all of them. As to our feelings about working in the field of nuclear development, I have already mentioned my reaction when the atomic bomb ended World War II. When I was at Los Alamos the Cold War was just developing, and many felt that we were saving the country ( others, of course, the contrary). I don\u2019t think Herb felt a sense of guilt, he thought the work quite necessary and defensible. But that does not preclude the regret that we and most people felt, that such a terrible weapon was necessary in our supposedly enlightened civilization. I do still hope that we won\u2019t give up the quest for developing the concept for renewable energy\u2014 it could save our planet rather than destroy it\u2014 and someday power our spaceships to the stars. Return to the Pacific In 1989, Herb accompanied a group who had worked on the Pacific tests on a trip arranged by Los Alamos to Eniwetok and Bikini, where the natives had been allowed to return UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 16 after the government had restored those atolls to a habitable state. The US was, of course, concerned about how the people would adjust or adapt to going back. Herb thought that the US had done an excellent job of returning the islands to the way the natives wanted them. But he was disturbed by the fact that their lives did not seem to have much incentive, that it was essentially a welfare state. I\u2019d like to say a little here about Roger Ray, for whom Herb had so much admiration because of Roger\u2019s concern for the Marshallese. Roger was assigned to J- Division as an Army Major in 1953, and participated in several overseas operations thereafter. As I learned later ( I quote from his e- mail of 8- 15- 05): \u201c My last military assignment was as Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy. Then came assignment as Operations Director of the Nevada Test Site, and then a second retirement. Somewhere in there I learned of efforts to re- settle the former inhabitants of Enewetak in their ancient home. It was my good fortune to have the opportunity to organize in behalf of both the Defense Dept and the Atomic Energy Commission, their efforts to rehabilitate this native homeland of a kind and gentle people who were so deserving.\u201d While he expresses frustration for \u201c having been less than a success in improving our official stewardship,\u201d he says, \u201c I have tried to at least leave a record for those who might at some time later pick up that challenge.\u201d Roger\u2019s story will be told elsewhere. It is an important part of our testing history. Las Vegas \u2013 La Jolla Herb and I lived in Las Vegas for 23 years, watching it grow and grow. EG wish now I\u2019d studied computers.) Since this was also a second marriage for Herb, I have two stepchildren, Joan who lives in San Luis Obispo, CA now, and Herb III who\u2019s in Parker, CO, near Denver. They have children, too, so I\u2019m blessed with five grandchildren ( including David\u2019s two boys) and two great- grandchildren. We are all very close. In 1977 we moved to La Jolla, CA, and found much happiness in our new environment. Herb died in 1999. While a longstanding and increasingly debilitating peripheral neuropathy hampers my activities, I am fortunate to have excellent care and be able to enjoy friends, family and my garden. The recently opened Atomic Testing Museum in Las Vegas, made possible by so UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 18 many dedicated members of the Nevada Test Site Historical Foundation, has been a great source of stimulation, of making new acquaintances and renewing old ones, and reliving memories.

The goal is to create an archive which adds relevant material to the existing historical record. Oral history recordings and transcripts are primary source material and do not represent the final, verified, or complete narrative of the events under discussion. Rather, oral history is a spoken remembrance or dialogue, reflecting the interviewee\u2019s memories, points of view and personal opinions about events in response to the interviewer\u2019s specific questions. Oral history interviews document each interviewee\u2019s personal engagement with the history in question. They are unique records, reflecting the particular meaning the interviewee draws from her/ his individual life experience.

Suzanne Becker: If I could just get a little about you, where you\u2019re from and\u2014 Joyce Parkhurst: I was born in Long Beach [ CA]. My parents were born in Long Beach. So I have a history here. We live here in Long Beach part of the year, and part of the year we live in the Sierras. We have a small cabin in the Sierras. And we don\u2019t always get to spend that six months, but we did this last year, and we came from there to go to the [ Nevada Desert Experience] meeting in August. So we\u2019re both retired, and have that luxury of being able to move around, spend that time. And when you say \u201c both,\u201d you\u2019re talking about your husband? Yes. What\u2019s his name? Jim. And, let\u2019s see, I am sixty- nine years old. You mentioned earlier you\u2019re a nurse, or were in nursing? I went to the University of Wisconsin but I only stayed a year and a half. So did I! Yes, I think we talked about that. And I got married, then I was fortunate; I didn\u2019t have to work while the kids were growing up. But I went back to school when I was forty- one and got my nursing [ degree], and nursed then for fourteen years. Then when Jim retired, I retired with him and we moved to our ranch outside of Bishop. And that\u2019s where your cabin is? Our cabin is actually north of there. It\u2019s outside of Bridgeport. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 2 And you also have a ranch. We sold the ranch, and then we moved here. We had been working with the Catholic Worker, and when we moved into the Catholic Worker house in Los Angeles, we left the ranch. We gave it to some people to use for six years, and then they finally bought it. Then we moved to Oakland briefly to have our own Catholic Worker house for almost four years. Oakland shut us down, shut down what we were doing. They were gentrifying the area that we lived in and that we were serving breakfast in, so they didn\u2019t want so many homeless people visible. Now the homeless lived there in that area anyway, but they were trying to gentrify the area, and didn\u2019t want the lines [ we served breakfast five days a week]. So we said OK, let\u2019s go back home. We came back and have worked for the last three years with the L. A. Worker again, on a part- time basis; not living in the house but helping out with their work and doing their protests and vigiling and serving. So we\u2019ve done more back- and- forthing in moving than we did for a number of years before that when we were more stable as a family. I, being the age I am, was ten years old when the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and I remember how horrifying that was, the pictures. My mother was devastated. She had at one time been going with a Japanese man, and so I\u2019m sure that that struck her very hard. It has always been something that I have found very distressing. Did you have a sense of it as a kid, that it was just pretty horrific? Yes. That\u2019s always been an issue, I think, because of being so young and the pictures\u2014 Life magazine and the pictures in the paper. And I remember even when I was teaching a class, and this was when I was in my twenties or early thirties, for young people, confirmation [ class]. I cut out these big pictures and made posters of them, and they were of the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. So [ for] a lot of the years that was something that was just a continuing issue. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 3 After being at the Catholic Worker, that\u2019s always been an issue of [ 00: 05: 00] theirs because Ammon Hennacey who was one of the Catholic workers, he was a friend of Dorothy Day\u2019s, he spent a lot of time at the [ Nevada] test site every year. The house in Los Angeles is named for him. He would go out to the test site every year, and every year he would fast for the number of days for the number of years that it had been. Well, by the time it got down to like forty years, why, he was\u2014 That\u2019s a long fast. A lot. So the Catholic workers have always had a presence. In that year that they were trying to decide what they wanted to do for\u2014 you know they do have the regular demonstrations, and we have always participated in the kind of a choreographed thing where they know we\u2019re coming, we say we\u2019re not going to do anything bad, and we cross the line, and they give you a ticket. I think they tear them all up as soon as we\u2019re gone. It has a meaning but it\u2019s still, you\u2019re still cooperating with the test site people. So this year we went up early and we decided that we would do something a little more. We had spent a lot of time thinking about it, a lot of time trying to discern what it was we wanted to do, so we decided we would cut the fence. And what year was that? It was\u2014 I think it was \u2019 97. It was the August of \u2019 97, and it was the ninth of August that we did it. And we had bolt cutters\u2014 these long- handled bolt cutters with the red handles. A couple of artists in the house had drawn symbols all over them, cactus and coyotes and rabbits and flowers and clouds and rain. Then the liturgy we had before we left, they were on the table, and they were really quite pretty. Then they the deputies confiscated them. I was always so sorry about that because they were really well done. And so we decided Martha and I would do this. Martha\u2019s last name is\u2014? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 4 Martha, well, at that time her name was Scarbrough, and she\u2019s since married. And so we spent the night at the test site, outside the fence. In the peace camp area? Yes. And the next morning, it was still dark, five o\u2019clock. The rest of the group went to the line and they had their guitars and they were singing. Martha and I, in the dark, we started out. It was five- strand barbed wire, so we had already planned ahead of time what we would do so we could go as fast as possible\u2014 we\u2019d each go to a fence post. I would take one, she\u2019d take one, and we\u2019d go clip, clip, clip, clip, clip. Then we\u2019d move up the ten feet and do it to the next one so that we were completely cutting ten- foot, you know, the fence all the way down. So it was cut from top to bottom, all the way down? Top to bottom, all the way down. And then we\u2019d move to the next one. We started\u2014 well, they\u2019ve changed the fence a little bit, but we had started right by the freeway and were heading up, which was almost a quarter of a mile, I think. We kept thinking\u2014 it kept getting lighter and lighter and the people were standing there singing and the guards were sitting right there, looking right at us, why can\u2019t they see what we\u2019re doing? We just kept right on going. They usually have to see you doing something before making an arrest. So we started singing as we cut. Well, we got all the way up to the line, right in front of them, before they really saw what we were doing. Then they jumped up [ 00: 10: 00] and ran across the road, because we were so close at that point, and yanked the bolt cutters out of our hands and put us under arrest, put us into the patrol car, and took us to Beatty. So they didn\u2019t just write you a ticket. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 5 No. No. They were really mad. I think they were mad because they missed it. So Martha and I were in Beatty for\u2014 I think they have to see you after twenty- four hours, and there\u2019s a magistrate there. This is on a Sunday that you were doing this? Yeah. And then this was early in the morning. Right, so you had all day\u2014 So we were all day Sunday in this hellhole at that time, that old jail in Beatty, and they took us into the\u2014 I\u2019m not sure now\u2014 I think they saw us twice. I think they saw us the next morning, and then we were in jail for eight days. You\u2019re kidding. Yeah, I think so. And you were in there for eight days because they wouldn\u2019t see you or because\u2014 wouldn\u2019t there be any bail posted? I think they had one hearing, and then we were going to have another one, an arraignment or something. So I think they kept us in Beatty for three days, and then they sent us to Tonopah, because it was a gross misdemeanor. Nevada is the only place that has a gross misdemeanor. It wasn\u2019t a felony. But this judge, magistrate, could only hear misdemeanors, so they had to send us up to Judge [ John] Davis. I think we were three days in Beatty, and they were really nasty to us. We had a little 20- watt bulb in the cell and it was one of those concrete cells with the bars in the front, and nobody would come and see us. We couldn\u2019t make a phone call. We couldn\u2019t take a shower. It was nasty. It was really nasty. When we got to Tonopah, it was like this was\u2014 Luxury? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 6 Luxury, yeah. And you could tell. I\u2019ll get to that later. But when we were in Tonopah, you could tell when people were coming in from Beatty because they were dirty and disheveled and had this deer- in- the- headlights look. So they took us to Tonopah and then they brought us back for our arraignment. That same judge did see us on that one, and he indicated that even if we didn\u2019t sign out, he was going to sign us out anyway. He wasn\u2019t going to keep us. So we went home after I think it was eight days. So how is it that you weren\u2019t allowed a phone call or to contact anyone? Because I would assume that the folks back at the test site knew that you had been arrested. I suppose if we had wanted to call a lawyer or let somebody [ know], we could have done that. But we couldn\u2019t just make a phone call like in most jails you can call somebody collect. This was a pay phone and they just didn\u2019t have that facility. But we did have to come back [ to court again]. They had said we were going to have to come back in September to Tonopah. So we did that. Martha and I had already decided\u2014 I don\u2019t know if you heard this story, but Tonopah had a really nice courthouse, and we decided we weren\u2019t going to stand up for the judge. So the bailiff comes in and he says, All stand, and everybody stands but us, and we\u2019re in the front row. They glared at us but they didn\u2019t say anything. Then when he left for the recess we didn\u2019t stand up, and we still hadn\u2019t been heard. The next time the judge came in after lunch, we were still sitting down. The bailiff got really upset and yelled at us. And the judge said, OK, you\u2019re [ 00: 15: 00] in civil contempt, and they took us and put us in a cell all day long while different guards kept coming in, trying to get us to change our minds. Well, it got to be six o\u2019clock. Poor Jim had been in the courtroom all day long, waiting to see what was going to happen. We finally went out into the courtroom. And we didn\u2019t have a lawyer. We were just doing this on our own. I didn\u2019t qualify for a public defender UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 7 anyway, but Martha could have. When we came back out to see the judge they had taken all the chairs out, so we had to stand. I thought that was so funny. Unbelievable. Well, they then told us that we had to come back again for another court date. You can go on and on and on with this. So I think we went back one more time. The next time we went back, they wanted us to fill out a probation thing and that whole business. Martha and I finally told the judge we wanted to plead guilty to this. We were not doing a non- guilty thing. We finally managed to get him to accept our plea. He didn\u2019t want to accept it? He didn\u2019t want us to be doing this without a lawyer. You don\u2019t talk to the judge. But he finally said, I accept your plea of guilty. You come back in December for sentencing. And we said, You know, we\u2019ve been here four times and we\u2019re not coming back. Sentence us now. We\u2019re coming a long way. And he said, No, I\u2019m not going to do that. And Martha said, Well, we\u2019re not coming back. And he said, Well, you will come back or I\u2019ll send somebody after you. And I said, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to send people to Los Angeles to pick us up. He said, Oh yes I will. So Nevada State kept sending us bills for two thousand dollars apiece to pay for the fence. It turns out we had cut something like sixteen hundred feet of fence. No, it\u2019s more than that. I figured out by the time we got done, that with the five strands we had cut approximately a mile of fence. So it would\u2019ve been more like five thousand. So time went on. Martha had gone to visit UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 8 people in jail and nothing had happened, so she felt free to protest at the federal building that following December. [ She was protesting against the sanctions and the subsequent deaths of children in Iraq.] That would\u2019ve been eighty\u2014 ninety\u2014 Late nineties? Ninety- eight? Let\u2019s see, the action was in \u2019 97, it would\u2019ve been December of \u2019 98. She got picked up. They found her record and they extradited her\u2014 they let her sit there for almost two weeks. You have fourteen days to come and get somebody. It was I think twelve days, and somebody called me from the house and said, Nevada has come for Martha and they\u2019re taking her to Tonopah. This was January eleventh. So Jim and I got in the truck. We were in Oakland. We had just started our Catholic Worker. We drove all night and got to Tonopah at six o\u2019clock in the morning, and I turned myself in. So Martha and I got there almost at the same time. She, having been there a few hours more, got to be seen arraigned the next day\u2014 Tuesday. It worked out that we both went to court on the [ following] Wednesday. He [ Judge Davis] sentenced us both to nine months. Everybody was absolutely stunned. I think what really [ 00: 20: 00] made him angry was that there was a huge demonstration outside the courthouse. A lot of people came from Los Angeles. The Native Americans came\u2014 the Shundahai. Yes. He was there with his people with big\u2014 Was that Corbin [ Harney]? Yeah, Corbin. Big signs, and the courthouse, the courtroom, was jammed. Now this is in Tonopah? This is in Tonopah. OK, and they\u2019re protesting because you are having your sentencing that day? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 9 Yes. They were in support of us. Well, I think he (the judge) was just really angry that they were all there and that he felt pushed. Martha went first, and I could hear him yelling at her, and she\u2014 I have it here in this Agitator. It\u2019s got Martha\u2019s statement in here, as well as mine\u2014 I think this is the one. I went second and after hearing him screaming at her\u2014 we did have a public defender, Martha did have a public defender for that. On his own he said, I\u2019ll stand with you so that you\u2019ll have somebody with you. So just as I was going to stand there and make my statement, he leans over and he says, You need to know, Martha just got sentenced to nine months. Oh, great I thought. Oh well, nothing matters now. So I went ahead and made my speech. What were you thinking when he said nine months? Well, we were just so stunned. Jim wasn\u2019t there. I told him, I said, I really don\u2019t want you to go. It would have been a long drive for him all the way from Oakland. And he was sorry afterwards, but I was glad he wasn\u2019t there because I was so nervous that I knew I would be even more nervous\u2014 here it is [ sound of pages turning]. Here\u2019s the picture of the\u2014 Oh, wow! That\u2019s a lot of people. So you can keep that if you want to. OK, if you have an extra copy I would like to. It has my statement in it and it has Martha\u2019s statement in it. OK. And The Catholic Agitator. Now is this\u2014? That\u2019s the Catholic Worker newsletter, the Los Angeles\u2014 Great. And you guys made the front cover. Oh, yeah, I have that picture a big picture of that\u2014 with our bolt cutters in our hands. You probably can\u2019t see them there but we\u2014 UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 10 A little bit. So it ended up being nine months. Yeah. Now with good time, I think you get a day a month good time. We\u2019d already served eight days, so it ended up being seven months. That\u2019s still significant. It\u2019s significant. It was hard. And that ended up being in Tonopah. Tonopah. Which after being in other jails, I would have to say that Tonopah was run very nicely. It was not a horrifying place to be, like Los Angeles is a horrifying place to be. And the sergeant in charge, his philosophy was if you treat people with respect, they will respond the same way. So I have to say, it could\u2019ve been worse. And so you were in there with all the\u2014 I mean how large is the Tonopah jail? Not large. Sentences varied from one day to a few hours. Sometimes there was just me and Martha. Our [ 00: 25: 00] pod could house sixteen women. Mostly we had an average of ten, so we could have our own cell, which was really nice. They were single cells and a couple of them had an extra bunk, but not like L. A. where you were stacked three high and jammed in. The doors were solid with just a little window in. And you were under constant surveillance in the day room. They had that new kind of jail where the pods all circle a central bubble, and then you have cameras and they can see right in all the time. And I think they can hear you. A couple of times, we became aware that they were responding to us as though they could hear what we were saying. But the woman who was the person overseeing it in the bubble and the one guard were really very nice people. These were town people, and they were country people. Tonopah\u2019s not a very big town. So it was a whole different attitude. Their community was observing them, to a certain extent, so their behavior was nice. They weren\u2019t going to be awful and then have people UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 11 talking about them. They were really nice people anyway. I mean one of the women was buying me stamps and envelopes so that I could keep up with my mail. And I even had one guard who was reading the Agitator, because the Agitator was coming to us. So, you know, I think we did a little bit of [ good]\u2014 they [ the other inmates] called us the church ladies. But I think that they felt like we were doing good in there because we were able to keep a lid on a lot of stuff that was going on. We were just so calm. Did they [ other inmates] know why you guys were in there? Yes. What was their reaction to that? Oh, they were very positive. They were very supportive of us. We found whenever we were in jail that the people we were in jail with got it\u2014 they really understood what we were trying to do. It was very interesting. And women, of course, in jail are great. They\u2019re very supportive and very helpful and generally take care of each other. I imagine it\u2019s a whole different experience than guys in jail. The guys, even Jim when he was in men\u2019s downtown L. A., probably because of his age, but they\u2019d call him Pops. But he didn\u2019t have any trouble either. Maybe because he happened to get in with a couple of the old- timers that were there and they looked out for him. One guy came up and tried to intimidate him and tell him that he wanted his money and wanted him to get him something. Jim just laughed at him and that was that. How long have you guys been involved? Both you and Jim are involved and have been involved with the Nevada Desert Experience [ NDE] on and off throughout the years, is that right? Actually no. Through the Los Angeles house, we have been involved with it since \u2019 96. Jack, I can\u2019t think of his last name, Jack and Felicity who put out the Nuclear Resister, they live in UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 12 Arizona, he called me and wanted to do an interview while I was in Tonopah, which was kind of fun. But as far as the Nevada Desert Experience, I think we\u2019ve [ been going] off and on [ only] since \u2019 96. Had you been out to the test site prior to that, prior to being involved with NDE? No. We\u2019d gone out to do the usual thing on\u2014[ anniversaries of Hiroshima and Nagasaki] and we went out in \u2019 96 to do the action and then we went again\u2014 The anniversary? [ 00: 30: 00] The anniversary thing, and then we went again, a couple of times after I was in jail, but nothing more than that. No, we hadn\u2019t really gone out there beforehand. I had been out that way, I think, accidentally. When I graduated from high school in \u2019 53, my mother and I were driving to the University of Wisconsin, so we were taking a road trip to get there. We were in Vegas the night before, we were heading for St. George [ Utah], and the ground was shaking in the showroom. Somebody said oh, they just put off another test out at the test site. And of course then we drove straight up through downwind of the whole mess, you know. That was \u2019 53. But no, I was mostly not involved. But it seems like you\u2019ve always had an awareness of the nuclear testing issue. Do you remember obviously when the test site came to be, when it became the Nevada Test Site? Because I know in Las Vegas, it was a big deal. I don\u2019t know how big of a deal it was to in California or other surrounding areas. Well, we were very aware that they were doing testing there, partly because my father really liked gambling, and so he would go to Las Vegas a couple times a year. So he\u2019d tell us a little bit about it. I think we just always knew it was there, but I never had the opportunity to drive that far to go and see it. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 13 What inspired you at the point back in \u2019 96 to go out there? Oh, I think it was just that\u2014 I don\u2019t know. Part of it, we had had a speaker on the nuclear weapons, and I think that that\u2014 At the Catholic Worker? Yeah. Dan Hirsch who knows a lot about the evils of that whole thing. I think that I was in a place that I needed to do something concrete. You could see with the sanctions in Iraq and that we were heading off into a direction where we might be going to use those [ weapons] again. We had a sense that they hadn\u2019t really stopped testing, that they were still doing it. And I think I wanted to make a stand. I wanted to just say we can\u2019t go there again. What were your impressions when you actually got out there? Barren. Barren. But you know there is so much life in the desert. The night before we did the fence was probably one of the most beautiful nights I\u2019ve ever seen. Somebody drove out and tried to tell us that we couldn\u2019t camp out there because there was going to be a terrible rainstorm and that we would all get washed away. Well, it had rained, but it cleared and the moon was up. It was really quite spectacular. And then you could see where they\u2019d done their bomb runs and all that. It\u2019s such a shame because the desert really is lovely. The night that they moved Martha and me from Beatty to Tonopah, they did it in the middle of the night at like one o\u2019clock in the morning, but it was such a gorgeous night with the stars and the moon and everything. When they brought us back down to court that first time at [ 00: 35: 00] Beatty, the driver pointed out to us a herd of mustang out on the right- hand side of the road that we got to see. You know, it looks barren but it really isn\u2019t. It\u2019s full of life, and I really feel so sorry for Nevada. I feel like Nevada has just had terrible things done to it. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 14 Yes. A lot of people argue it both ways because it is the desert, I think, it really gets perceived as\u2014 Nothing. \u2014 something that you can sort of use. And it\u2019s barren like you say, but by the same token it\u2019s something full of life, so it\u2019s an interesting juxtaposition. Yeah. I think this was probably before you went out there, but I had the chance to talk to Jim Merlino, who was the sheriff in Mercury. I don\u2019t know if you ever had the opportunity to meet him, but he ran the test site security for years, and he had a really interesting perspective and rapport with a lot of the regular folks that were going out there. I\u2019m wondering if you, in your times out there, had a chance to interact with any of the guards? While they were patting us down? Yes, aside from being arrested. No. I think that probably the Las Vegas Catholic Worker people did because they had to make arrangements with them. I assume, though, you\u2019ve also taken part in crossing the line in one way, shape, or form and just getting the ticket. Yeah. I\u2019m curious what sort of meaning that holds for you, the significance; whether it\u2019s personal or symbolic or both. I think it\u2019s both. It\u2019s keeping it fresh in your memory that it\u2019s there and what it means and what we\u2019ve done. I think we can\u2019t forget what we did to the people of Japan. And it\u2019s symbolic in that I believe that everything we do adds up. The symbolism of cutting the fence, from my point of UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 15 view, is to symbolically take down the fence so that people could see what was happening inside. It was making an opening so that this was not hidden away and done in secret, which it still is. So it\u2019s both. It\u2019s too easy to forget, and the younger people, younger generation, they don\u2019t even know. I couldn\u2019t believe, what was it, [ Secretary of Defense Donald] Rumsfeld who said at one point when they were trying to talk up bombing Iraq because they [ Iraq] had weapons of mass destruction, and they didn\u2019t want to ever see an atomic bomb detonated on this planet. What? Are you forgetting? Or are you just making it so that all the people who don\u2019t know won\u2019t know? Right. It certainly is an interesting part of our history. Definitely a part of our culture, for sure. It is interesting, too, that it came up in Congress just last week [ Nov. 2004] to vote for a renewed proliferation of these so- called small nuclear weapons. I wrote to both Senator [ Barbara] Boxer and Senator [ Dianne] Feinstein, and I didn\u2019t get an answer from Senator Boxer but I did get one from Senator Feinstein. She was voting against it. And it did go down in the Senate. But they\u2019re going to keep trying. There\u2019s only two issues that I really would get out there [ 00: 40: 00] again and go to jail for again; one of them is the nuclear issue, and the other is the draft. Do you foresee them making the test site active again? I know there\u2019s been talk. I do. I really do. And at some time in the next four years. The troops are sparse. They\u2019re going to want something that\u2019s really, really bad. It seems like you\u2019ve been politically active\u2014 you\u2019re just a politically active person. Yeah, but more though in the last ten years probably. What other things have you been involved in? I mean this seems like something of pretty great magnitude. I\u2019ve never protested or done anything like that before. I\u2019ve written letters and made phone calls on various things: the environment, high- rise buildings on the beach, you know, all those kinds UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 16 of things. And then after I\u2019d been in jail this time, then it was easier. I mean we protested Nike, we protested The Gap, we\u2019ve been arrested and then let go. We protested the Iraq War and did eight days in the Twin Towers [ Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Correctional Facility] for that. Oh, wow. Yeah, that was really an experience. And that\u2019s here in L. A.? Yes. We also protested at the federal building and we got arrested by the federals. They would not put us in jail, Jim and I, because we had too much money in the bank. We weren\u2019t like the other Catholic Workers who have zip. So they fined us. They put us on probation. We have two more years to go. And they fined us thirty- five hundred dollars. And this was for standing with a sign, not moving, saying a prayer, not in anybody\u2019s way, not blocking a doorway\u2014 This was in L. A. at the federal building? In L. A. The federal building downtown. I mean it was strictly within our rights. This paper has both of our statements to the judge which, as Jim said in his and I echoed it in mine, that a right that when exercised is punished, is no right. There were no signs in there saying that you could not stand there. Right. And this was based on what, being on private property? Being on their property. They told us to leave and we didn\u2019t. But you know people were there all day long. It just happened to be because we were carrying a sign. People sit there and eat their lunch but they don\u2019t bother them. Right. The act of protest has changed. And they\u2019re all in their SWAT things. So I think it\u2019s only going to get worse. It seems to be getting more punitive. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 17 Makes you wonder how that\u2019s going to actually impact the act of protest. Something like going out to the test site, even. It\u2019ll be interesting. The federal government did not get involved with ours. It was the State of Nevada, because that periphery fence is on, supposedly, Nevada. So the federal government did not get involved. Now if we could figure out a way to get into Mercury then it would be federal. Right. And it probably would have looked like a very different scene had the federal government gotten involved, I would imagine. It\u2019s hard to say whether it would\u2019ve been more or less, but due to the damage, people have [ 00: 45: 00] gotten six months for just crossing the line at Fort Benning [ Georgia, School of the Americas]. So because we did damage it could\u2019ve been more. Given your experience, would you do it again? Yeah. I think at this point I would have to have an excuse, more of a\u2014 if they started testing weapons out there again, then I think I would. You mentioned a little earlier that you had kids. Yes. How many kids do you have? I have five, two men and three women now, and they range from forty- eight to forty. Every two years. Very close in age. And then we have eight grandchildren, ranging from three to twenty- two. That\u2019s quite a range. What do they think about your involvement, and are they politically active at all? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 18 Our daughter that is forty- one\u2014 forty- two, she\u2019ll be forty- two in December, teaches\u2014 is a professor at Soka University. She finished her dissertation she started three or four years ago. It was on nations and how they\u2019re perceived by the way the media presents them. The nations she was working with were North Korea, Iraq, those two mostly, and think there was one more but I can\u2019t think of what it is. She\u2019s teaching political science but she also has a lot of non- nuclear stuff in there. She has a lot of foreign students, a large amount of Japanese, and she has spent some time in Japan and has visited Hiroshima. So I would say that she is politically active. The textbook she\u2019s using has a forward in it by Phil Berrigan. So she\u2019s very much. The other daughter who\u2019s forty- four is getting her teaching certificate. But she has protested with us at some of the marches, but what she prefers, she is very interested in the children that are being left behind in the \u201c No Child Left Behind\u201d project; children that there\u2019s no way that they can keep up. She\u2019s very good with troubled children. The youngest who is forty was so appalled that I was in jail, she couldn\u2019t even write me a letter. Jennifer, the one who\u2019s the teacher, came to see me. Jocelyn was in Washington State at that time, so she couldn\u2019t. But she wrote and her children wrote. And the two men, they would take a phone call if I called them but they\u2014 one wrote one letter, but the other one didn\u2019t. I think that they were just horrified that we were in jail. They were worried about us, and just really didn\u2019t know what to do. Jim, bless his heart, drove from Oakland once a month to visit me. My father had me phone him once a week. And I have to say he is definitely not\u2014 he\u2019s definitely a right- wing Republican, but my being his daughter superseded that. He at least, I think, wanted to know if I was doing OK. We lost a lot of friends. My sister and my brother were very angry and didn\u2019t want to talk about it. They didn\u2019t write\u2014 UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 19 Do you think because of the actual physically being in jail or the whole circumstance, the being out at the test site and the\u2014 I think my sister thought it was just an awful thing to break the law. My brother was not [ 00: 50: 00] quite that adamant. My brother had been in Vietnam and I just don\u2019t talk to him about the whole peace movement. He can\u2019t handle it. For him to admit that his government put them all in harm\u2019s way for no reason and are doing it again, he can\u2019t deal with that. It\u2019s just too painful. So he has to pretend that they\u2019re OK. I have another friend that I\u2019ve known for fifty years and she has made me promise\u2014 well, I told her I wouldn\u2019t promise but she tries to get me to promise that I will never do that again. They don\u2019t really quite understand. What you were doing, and why. Yeah. Well, it\u2019s a lot of personal dedication and conviction, which I think people don\u2019t [ understand] unless they have something that they can relate that to. The funny thing is that I heard from some friends when we were getting ready for our fiftieth high school reunion, and had mentioned to them that I couldn\u2019t come because I was going to be in jail at that time. Then one thing led to another as far as explanations and they found my\u2014 one of them had put in Joyce Parkhurst in the Google and up came my rap sheet. And I got several phone calls from people I hadn\u2019t seen in fifty years saying good for you. So you never know. I had a question sort of unrelated but I\u2019m wondering if\u2014 I\u2019ve had people tell me that they remember being able to see some of the clouds and the bright lights, when they used to do shots out at the test site, from California. I\u2019m wondering if you ever\u2014 UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 20 You know, I don\u2019t remember anything like that. I really don\u2019t. I remember things from during the Second World War but I don\u2019t remember that. I think we\u2019re just too bright, maybe. And it sounds like, too, you were headed toward Wisconsin at that time for part of it, as well. I think maybe if you were up higher, too. Yeah, that could be, because I guess these folks were closer to northern California. But I just thought well, that\u2019s really a powerful blast. That would be pretty scary. So are there any other thoughts or stories or related stories that you feel are important? I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll think of things after you stop, but I can\u2019t think of anything right now. Do you have plans to go next summer to the [ test site]\u2014? Probably. Is that something you\u2019re going to continue? Yeah, we like to go on that weekend. It\u2019s meaningful to us partly because one of our friends, Ladon Sheats was very involved in that and he died on the seventh of August, so it\u2019s a kind of a memorial for him as well. But I remember it every year. I always have remembered it every year. I can\u2019t remember a year since I was a child that I did not remember the people of Japan on that day. It\u2019s just part of me. Right. Well, as you mentioned, it was significant in your mom\u2019s life as well. Yeah. Were both your parents fairly conservative? Yes. I think my mother, if she had been\u2014 you have to understand the times. My mother was kind of under my father\u2019s thumb to a certain extent, and I think my mother on her own, left to her own devices, would have been much more liberal. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 21 So it\u2019s interesting that you took the opposite route. Yeah. I think where I am, I think that\u2019s the way she was when she was younger. And my brother and my sister didn\u2019t get quite as much of that input, so they didn\u2019t come out the same [ 00: 55: 00] way. We\u2019re polar opposites, really. Yeah, often is in families. I always find that interesting. Yeah, Jim and his brother, same way. So you\u2019re here in California now through the winter? Yes. And then you\u2019re heading back to your cabin? Yeah, hopefully next April. I definitely appreciate you taking the time to do this and to tell your story. It\u2019s very interesting. Oh, it\u2019s a pleasure. Probably just because of your timing, you don\u2019t have a chance to meet folks that actually work out at the test site, I\u2019m imagining. No. And of course there\u2019s only a couple thousand people that are still employed there, but just wondering what you think. I mean do you have any animosity toward them, or maybe \u201c animosity\u201d isn\u2019t the correct word\u2014 Really, my animosity is more towards the government that does this. I understand people have to make a living, but I would hope that they would think about it. Right. I mean I can\u2019t make a judgment on what somebody has to do. Right. Well, and especially for Nevada. At one point it was such a huge employer for people. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 22 Yeah. But just curious, you know. So, all right, if you think of anything else that pertains to this, let me know. Otherwise I certainly appreciate you taking the time, especially on a holiday weekend. I\u2019m glad to. I don\u2019t mind. I don\u2019t know if you can use this. This is something I wrote while I was in jail. It may be too religious but it\u2019s kind of like a meditation. Can I keep this stuff? Oh, yes, you can keep that. And this one is a\u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re interested in the jail time in Los Angeles. Sure. This was an article. I can give you the whole paper, but this \u201c Tired, Cold, and Hungry\u201d is my story of what it was like to be in jail in Los Angeles. How long have you been involved with the Catholic Worker? I worked with the Catholic Worker in the mid- eighties. I worked in their clinic for a year. I went every Friday and helped them out, and then my\u2014 In their clinic? Downtown L. A. And then my grandchildren started coming and so I was doing pretty full- time babysitting so my daughters\u2014 because they were single parents\u2014 could go to work. So when we retired, Jim was looking around particularly for some place to go. In \u2019 95 he went to stay with the Catholic Worker for a month, and then he began going from the ranch to L. A. for two weeks every month to stay with them. And after about a year of that, I started going. That\u2019s when we began to realize that it was sort of silly for us to be running up and down Highway 395\u2014 somebody wanted to use it [ the ranch] for a halfway house, so we turned it over to them. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 23 So you became involved with them on a, I don\u2019t want to say you stumbled into it, but it was a less overt. Yes, he chose it because I had been associated with them, and partly because we began getting their Agitator and it really sparked our interest and it made sense. Yeah, which is good. Well, again, thank you. Well, you\u2019re welcome. Did you want to take this one, too? [ 01: 00: 00] Sure. Yes. You may not be able to use it, but I have a bunch of these, so you\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdre welcome to them. OK, if you have a bunch and you can spare one, that would be great.

The goal is to create an archive which adds relevant material to the existing historical record. Oral history recordings and transcripts are primary source material and do not represent the final, verified, or complete narrative of the events under discussion. Rather, oral history is a spoken remembrance or dialogue, reflecting the interviewee\u2019s memories, points of view and personal opinions about events in response to the interviewer\u2019s specific questions. Oral history interviews document each interviewee\u2019s personal engagement with the history in question. They are unique records, reflecting the particular meaning the interviewee draws from her/ his individual life experience.

Suzanne Becker: If I could just get a little about you, where you\u2019re from and\u2014 Joyce Parkhurst: I was born in Long Beach [ CA]. My parents were born in Long Beach. So I have a history here. We live here in Long Beach part of the year, and part of the year we live in the Sierras. We have a small cabin in the Sierras. And we don\u2019t always get to spend that six months, but we did this last year, and we came from there to go to the [ Nevada Desert Experience] meeting in August. So we\u2019re both retired, and have that luxury of being able to move around, spend that time. And when you say \u201c both,\u201d you\u2019re talking about your husband? Yes. What\u2019s his name? Jim. And, let\u2019s see, I am sixty- nine years old. You mentioned earlier you\u2019re a nurse, or were in nursing? I went to the University of Wisconsin but I only stayed a year and a half. So did I! Yes, I think we talked about that. And I got married, then I was fortunate; I didn\u2019t have to work while the kids were growing up. But I went back to school when I was forty- one and got my nursing [ degree], and nursed then for fourteen years. Then when Jim retired, I retired with him and we moved to our ranch outside of Bishop. And that\u2019s where your cabin is? Our cabin is actually north of there. It\u2019s outside of Bridgeport. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 2 And you also have a ranch. We sold the ranch, and then we moved here. We had been working with the Catholic Worker, and when we moved into the Catholic Worker house in Los Angeles, we left the ranch. We gave it to some people to use for six years, and then they finally bought it. Then we moved to Oakland briefly to have our own Catholic Worker house for almost four years. Oakland shut us down, shut down what we were doing. They were gentrifying the area that we lived in and that we were serving breakfast in, so they didn\u2019t want so many homeless people visible. Now the homeless lived there in that area anyway, but they were trying to gentrify the area, and didn\u2019t want the lines [ we served breakfast five days a week]. So we said OK, let\u2019s go back home. We came back and have worked for the last three years with the L. A. Worker again, on a part- time basis; not living in the house but helping out with their work and doing their protests and vigiling and serving. So we\u2019ve done more back- and- forthing in moving than we did for a number of years before that when we were more stable as a family. I, being the age I am, was ten years old when the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and I remember how horrifying that was, the pictures. My mother was devastated. She had at one time been going with a Japanese man, and so I\u2019m sure that that struck her very hard. It has always been something that I have found very distressing. Did you have a sense of it as a kid, that it was just pretty horrific? Yes. That\u2019s always been an issue, I think, because of being so young and the pictures\u2014 Life magazine and the pictures in the paper. And I remember even when I was teaching a class, and this was when I was in my twenties or early thirties, for young people, confirmation [ class]. I cut out these big pictures and made posters of them, and they were of the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. So [ for] a lot of the years that was something that was just a continuing issue. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 3 After being at the Catholic Worker, that\u2019s always been an issue of [ 00: 05: 00] theirs because Ammon Hennacey who was one of the Catholic workers, he was a friend of Dorothy Day\u2019s, he spent a lot of time at the [ Nevada] test site every year. The house in Los Angeles is named for him. He would go out to the test site every year, and every year he would fast for the number of days for the number of years that it had been. Well, by the time it got down to like forty years, why, he was\u2014 That\u2019s a long fast. A lot. So the Catholic workers have always had a presence. In that year that they were trying to decide what they wanted to do for\u2014 you know they do have the regular demonstrations, and we have always participated in the kind of a choreographed thing where they know we\u2019re coming, we say we\u2019re not going to do anything bad, and we cross the line, and they give you a ticket. I think they tear them all up as soon as we\u2019re gone. It has a meaning but it\u2019s still, you\u2019re still cooperating with the test site people. So this year we went up early and we decided that we would do something a little more. We had spent a lot of time thinking about it, a lot of time trying to discern what it was we wanted to do, so we decided we would cut the fence. And what year was that? It was\u2014 I think it was \u2019 97. It was the August of \u2019 97, and it was the ninth of August that we did it. And we had bolt cutters\u2014 these long- handled bolt cutters with the red handles. A couple of artists in the house had drawn symbols all over them, cactus and coyotes and rabbits and flowers and clouds and rain. Then the liturgy we had before we left, they were on the table, and they were really quite pretty. Then they the deputies confiscated them. I was always so sorry about that because they were really well done. And so we decided Martha and I would do this. Martha\u2019s last name is\u2014? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 4 Martha, well, at that time her name was Scarbrough, and she\u2019s since married. And so we spent the night at the test site, outside the fence. In the peace camp area? Yes. And the next morning, it was still dark, five o\u2019clock. The rest of the group went to the line and they had their guitars and they were singing. Martha and I, in the dark, we started out. It was five- strand barbed wire, so we had already planned ahead of time what we would do so we could go as fast as possible\u2014 we\u2019d each go to a fence post. I would take one, she\u2019d take one, and we\u2019d go clip, clip, clip, clip, clip. Then we\u2019d move up the ten feet and do it to the next one so that we were completely cutting ten- foot, you know, the fence all the way down. So it was cut from top to bottom, all the way down? Top to bottom, all the way down. And then we\u2019d move to the next one. We started\u2014 well, they\u2019ve changed the fence a little bit, but we had started right by the freeway and were heading up, which was almost a quarter of a mile, I think. We kept thinking\u2014 it kept getting lighter and lighter and the people were standing there singing and the guards were sitting right there, looking right at us, why can\u2019t they see what we\u2019re doing? We just kept right on going. They usually have to see you doing something before making an arrest. So we started singing as we cut. Well, we got all the way up to the line, right in front of them, before they really saw what we were doing. Then they jumped up [ 00: 10: 00] and ran across the road, because we were so close at that point, and yanked the bolt cutters out of our hands and put us under arrest, put us into the patrol car, and took us to Beatty. So they didn\u2019t just write you a ticket. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 5 No. No. They were really mad. I think they were mad because they missed it. So Martha and I were in Beatty for\u2014 I think they have to see you after twenty- four hours, and there\u2019s a magistrate there. This is on a Sunday that you were doing this? Yeah. And then this was early in the morning. Right, so you had all day\u2014 So we were all day Sunday in this hellhole at that time, that old jail in Beatty, and they took us into the\u2014 I\u2019m not sure now\u2014 I think they saw us twice. I think they saw us the next morning, and then we were in jail for eight days. You\u2019re kidding. Yeah, I think so. And you were in there for eight days because they wouldn\u2019t see you or because\u2014 wouldn\u2019t there be any bail posted? I think they had one hearing, and then we were going to have another one, an arraignment or something. So I think they kept us in Beatty for three days, and then they sent us to Tonopah, because it was a gross misdemeanor. Nevada is the only place that has a gross misdemeanor. It wasn\u2019t a felony. But this judge, magistrate, could only hear misdemeanors, so they had to send us up to Judge [ John] Davis. I think we were three days in Beatty, and they were really nasty to us. We had a little 20- watt bulb in the cell and it was one of those concrete cells with the bars in the front, and nobody would come and see us. We couldn\u2019t make a phone call. We couldn\u2019t take a shower. It was nasty. It was really nasty. When we got to Tonopah, it was like this was\u2014 Luxury? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 6 Luxury, yeah. And you could tell. I\u2019ll get to that later. But when we were in Tonopah, you could tell when people were coming in from Beatty because they were dirty and disheveled and had this deer- in- the- headlights look. So they took us to Tonopah and then they brought us back for our arraignment. That same judge did see us on that one, and he indicated that even if we didn\u2019t sign out, he was going to sign us out anyway. He wasn\u2019t going to keep us. So we went home after I think it was eight days. So how is it that you weren\u2019t allowed a phone call or to contact anyone? Because I would assume that the folks back at the test site knew that you had been arrested. I suppose if we had wanted to call a lawyer or let somebody [ know], we could have done that. But we couldn\u2019t just make a phone call like in most jails you can call somebody collect. This was a pay phone and they just didn\u2019t have that facility. But we did have to come back [ to court again]. They had said we were going to have to come back in September to Tonopah. So we did that. Martha and I had already decided\u2014 I don\u2019t know if you heard this story, but Tonopah had a really nice courthouse, and we decided we weren\u2019t going to stand up for the judge. So the bailiff comes in and he says, All stand, and everybody stands but us, and we\u2019re in the front row. They glared at us but they didn\u2019t say anything. Then when he left for the recess we didn\u2019t stand up, and we still hadn\u2019t been heard. The next time the judge came in after lunch, we were still sitting down. The bailiff got really upset and yelled at us. And the judge said, OK, you\u2019re [ 00: 15: 00] in civil contempt, and they took us and put us in a cell all day long while different guards kept coming in, trying to get us to change our minds. Well, it got to be six o\u2019clock. Poor Jim had been in the courtroom all day long, waiting to see what was going to happen. We finally went out into the courtroom. And we didn\u2019t have a lawyer. We were just doing this on our own. I didn\u2019t qualify for a public defender UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 7 anyway, but Martha could have. When we came back out to see the judge they had taken all the chairs out, so we had to stand. I thought that was so funny. Unbelievable. Well, they then told us that we had to come back again for another court date. You can go on and on and on with this. So I think we went back one more time. The next time we went back, they wanted us to fill out a probation thing and that whole business. Martha and I finally told the judge we wanted to plead guilty to this. We were not doing a non- guilty thing. We finally managed to get him to accept our plea. He didn\u2019t want to accept it? He didn\u2019t want us to be doing this without a lawyer. You don\u2019t talk to the judge. But he finally said, I accept your plea of guilty. You come back in December for sentencing. And we said, You know, we\u2019ve been here four times and we\u2019re not coming back. Sentence us now. We\u2019re coming a long way. And he said, No, I\u2019m not going to do that. And Martha said, Well, we\u2019re not coming back. And he said, Well, you will come back or I\u2019ll send somebody after you. And I said, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to send people to Los Angeles to pick us up. He said, Oh yes I will. So Nevada State kept sending us bills for two thousand dollars apiece to pay for the fence. It turns out we had cut something like sixteen hundred feet of fence. No, it\u2019s more than that. I figured out by the time we got done, that with the five strands we had cut approximately a mile of fence. So it would\u2019ve been more like five thousand. So time went on. Martha had gone to visit UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 8 people in jail and nothing had happened, so she felt free to protest at the federal building that following December. [ She was protesting against the sanctions and the subsequent deaths of children in Iraq.] That would\u2019ve been eighty\u2014 ninety\u2014 Late nineties? Ninety- eight? Let\u2019s see, the action was in \u2019 97, it would\u2019ve been December of \u2019 98. She got picked up. They found her record and they extradited her\u2014 they let her sit there for almost two weeks. You have fourteen days to come and get somebody. It was I think twelve days, and somebody called me from the house and said, Nevada has come for Martha and they\u2019re taking her to Tonopah. This was January eleventh. So Jim and I got in the truck. We were in Oakland. We had just started our Catholic Worker. We drove all night and got to Tonopah at six o\u2019clock in the morning, and I turned myself in. So Martha and I got there almost at the same time. She, having been there a few hours more, got to be seen arraigned the next day\u2014 Tuesday. It worked out that we both went to court on the [ following] Wednesday. He [ Judge Davis] sentenced us both to nine months. Everybody was absolutely stunned. I think what really [ 00: 20: 00] made him angry was that there was a huge demonstration outside the courthouse. A lot of people came from Los Angeles. The Native Americans came\u2014 the Shundahai. Yes. He was there with his people with big\u2014 Was that Corbin [ Harney]? Yeah, Corbin. Big signs, and the courthouse, the courtroom, was jammed. Now this is in Tonopah? This is in Tonopah. OK, and they\u2019re protesting because you are having your sentencing that day? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 9 Yes. They were in support of us. Well, I think he ( the judge) was just really angry that they were all there and that he felt pushed. Martha went first, and I could hear him yelling at her, and she\u2014 I have it here in this Agitator. It\u2019s got Martha\u2019s statement in here, as well as mine\u2014 I think this is the one. I went second and after hearing him screaming at her\u2014 we did have a public defender, Martha did have a public defender for that. On his own he said, I\u2019ll stand with you so that you\u2019ll have somebody with you. So just as I was going to stand there and make my statement, he leans over and he says, You need to know, Martha just got sentenced to nine months. Oh, great I thought. Oh well, nothing matters now. So I went ahead and made my speech. What were you thinking when he said nine months? Well, we were just so stunned. Jim wasn\u2019t there. I told him, I said, I really don\u2019t want you to go. It would have been a long drive for him all the way from Oakland. And he was sorry afterwards, but I was glad he wasn\u2019t there because I was so nervous that I knew I would be even more nervous\u2014 here it is [ sound of pages turning]. Here\u2019s the picture of the\u2014 Oh, wow! That\u2019s a lot of people. So you can keep that if you want to. OK, if you have an extra copy I would like to. It has my statement in it and it has Martha\u2019s statement in it. OK. And The Catholic Agitator. Now is this\u2014? That\u2019s the Catholic Worker newsletter, the Los Angeles\u2014 Great. And you guys made the front cover. Oh, yeah, I have that picture a big picture of that\u2014 with our bolt cutters in our hands. You probably can\u2019t see them there but we\u2014 UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 10 A little bit. So it ended up being nine months. Yeah. Now with good time, I think you get a day a month good time. We\u2019d already served eight days, so it ended up being seven months. That\u2019s still significant. It\u2019s significant. It was hard. And that ended up being in Tonopah. Tonopah. Which after being in other jails, I would have to say that Tonopah was run very nicely. It was not a horrifying place to be, like Los Angeles is a horrifying place to be. And the sergeant in charge, his philosophy was if you treat people with respect, they will respond the same way. So I have to say, it could\u2019ve been worse. And so you were in there with all the\u2014 I mean how large is the Tonopah jail? Not large. Sentences varied from one day to a few hours. Sometimes there was just me and Martha. Our [ 00: 25: 00] pod could house sixteen women. Mostly we had an average of ten, so we could have our own cell, which was really nice. They were single cells and a couple of them had an extra bunk, but not like L. A. where you were stacked three high and jammed in. The doors were solid with just a little window in. And you were under constant surveillance in the day room. They had that new kind of jail where the pods all circle a central bubble, and then you have cameras and they can see right in all the time. And I think they can hear you. A couple of times, we became aware that they were responding to us as though they could hear what we were saying. But the woman who was the person overseeing it in the bubble and the one guard were really very nice people. These were town people, and they were country people. Tonopah\u2019s not a very big town. So it was a whole different attitude. Their community was observing them, to a certain extent, so their behavior was nice. They weren\u2019t going to be awful and then have people UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 11 talking about them. They were really nice people anyway. I mean one of the women was buying me stamps and envelopes so that I could keep up with my mail. And I even had one guard who was reading the Agitator, because the Agitator was coming to us. So, you know, I think we did a little bit of [ good]\u2014 they [ the other inmates] called us the church ladies. But I think that they felt like we were doing good in there because we were able to keep a lid on a lot of stuff that was going on. We were just so calm. Did they [ other inmates] know why you guys were in there? Yes. What was their reaction to that? Oh, they were very positive. They were very supportive of us. We found whenever we were in jail that the people we were in jail with got it\u2014 they really understood what we were trying to do. It was very interesting. And women, of course, in jail are great. They\u2019re very supportive and very helpful and generally take care of each other. I imagine it\u2019s a whole different experience than guys in jail. The guys, even Jim when he was in men\u2019s downtown L. A., probably because of his age, but they\u2019d call him Pops. But he didn\u2019t have any trouble either. Maybe because he happened to get in with a couple of the old- timers that were there and they looked out for him. One guy came up and tried to intimidate him and tell him that he wanted his money and wanted him to get him something. Jim just laughed at him and that was that. How long have you guys been involved? Both you and Jim are involved and have been involved with the Nevada Desert Experience [ NDE] on and off throughout the years, is that right? Actually no. Through the Los Angeles house, we have been involved with it since \u2019 96. Jack, I can\u2019t think of his last name, Jack and Felicity who put out the Nuclear Resister, they live in UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 12 Arizona, he called me and wanted to do an interview while I was in Tonopah, which was kind of fun. But as far as the Nevada Desert Experience, I think we\u2019ve [ been going] off and on [ only] since \u2019 96. Had you been out to the test site prior to that, prior to being involved with NDE? No. We\u2019d gone out to do the usual thing on\u2014[ anniversaries of Hiroshima and Nagasaki] and we went out in \u2019 96 to do the action and then we went again\u2014 The anniversary? [ 00: 30: 00] The anniversary thing, and then we went again, a couple of times after I was in jail, but nothing more than that. No, we hadn\u2019t really gone out there beforehand. I had been out that way, I think, accidentally. When I graduated from high school in \u2019 53, my mother and I were driving to the University of Wisconsin, so we were taking a road trip to get there. We were in Vegas the night before, we were heading for St. George [ Utah], and the ground was shaking in the showroom. Somebody said oh, they just put off another test out at the test site. And of course then we drove straight up through downwind of the whole mess, you know. That was \u2019 53. But no, I was mostly not involved. But it seems like you\u2019ve always had an awareness of the nuclear testing issue. Do you remember obviously when the test site came to be, when it became the Nevada Test Site? Because I know in Las Vegas, it was a big deal. I don\u2019t know how big of a deal it was to in California or other surrounding areas. Well, we were very aware that they were doing testing there, partly because my father really liked gambling, and so he would go to Las Vegas a couple times a year. So he\u2019d tell us a little bit about it. I think we just always knew it was there, but I never had the opportunity to drive that far to go and see it. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 13 What inspired you at the point back in \u2019 96 to go out there? Oh, I think it was just that\u2014 I don\u2019t know. Part of it, we had had a speaker on the nuclear weapons, and I think that that\u2014 At the Catholic Worker? Yeah. Dan Hirsch who knows a lot about the evils of that whole thing. I think that I was in a place that I needed to do something concrete. You could see with the sanctions in Iraq and that we were heading off into a direction where we might be going to use those [ weapons] again. We had a sense that they hadn\u2019t really stopped testing, that they were still doing it. And I think I wanted to make a stand. I wanted to just say we can\u2019t go there again. What were your impressions when you actually got out there? Barren. Barren. But you know there is so much life in the desert. The night before we did the fence was probably one of the most beautiful nights I\u2019ve ever seen. Somebody drove out and tried to tell us that we couldn\u2019t camp out there because there was going to be a terrible rainstorm and that we would all get washed away. Well, it had rained, but it cleared and the moon was up. It was really quite spectacular. And then you could see where they\u2019d done their bomb runs and all that. It\u2019s such a shame because the desert really is lovely. The night that they moved Martha and me from Beatty to Tonopah, they did it in the middle of the night at like one o\u2019clock in the morning, but it was such a gorgeous night with the stars and the moon and everything. When they brought us back down to court that first time at [ 00: 35: 00] Beatty, the driver pointed out to us a herd of mustang out on the right- hand side of the road that we got to see. You know, it looks barren but it really isn\u2019t. It\u2019s full of life, and I really feel so sorry for Nevada. I feel like Nevada has just had terrible things done to it. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 14 Yes. A lot of people argue it both ways because it is the desert, I think, it really gets perceived as\u2014 Nothing. \u2014 something that you can sort of use. And it\u2019s barren like you say, but by the same token it\u2019s something full of life, so it\u2019s an interesting juxtaposition. Yeah. I think this was probably before you went out there, but I had the chance to talk to Jim Merlino, who was the sheriff in Mercury. I don\u2019t know if you ever had the opportunity to meet him, but he ran the test site security for years, and he had a really interesting perspective and rapport with a lot of the regular folks that were going out there. I\u2019m wondering if you, in your times out there, had a chance to interact with any of the guards? While they were patting us down? Yes, aside from being arrested. No. I think that probably the Las Vegas Catholic Worker people did because they had to make arrangements with them. I assume, though, you\u2019ve also taken part in crossing the line in one way, shape, or form and just getting the ticket. Yeah. I\u2019m curious what sort of meaning that holds for you, the significance; whether it\u2019s personal or symbolic or both. I think it\u2019s both. It\u2019s keeping it fresh in your memory that it\u2019s there and what it means and what we\u2019ve done. I think we can\u2019t forget what we did to the people of Japan. And it\u2019s symbolic in that I believe that everything we do adds up. The symbolism of cutting the fence, from my point of UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 15 view, is to symbolically take down the fence so that people could see what was happening inside. It was making an opening so that this was not hidden away and done in secret, which it still is. So it\u2019s both. It\u2019s too easy to forget, and the younger people, younger generation, they don\u2019t even know. I couldn\u2019t believe, what was it, [ Secretary of Defense Donald] Rumsfeld who said at one point when they were trying to talk up bombing Iraq because they [ Iraq] had weapons of mass destruction, and they didn\u2019t want to ever see an atomic bomb detonated on this planet. What? Are you forgetting? Or are you just making it so that all the people who don\u2019t know won\u2019t know? Right. It certainly is an interesting part of our history. Definitely a part of our culture, for sure. It is interesting, too, that it came up in Congress just last week [ Nov. 2004] to vote for a renewed proliferation of these so- called small nuclear weapons. I wrote to both Senator [ Barbara] Boxer and Senator [ Dianne] Feinstein, and I didn\u2019t get an answer from Senator Boxer but I did get one from Senator Feinstein. She was voting against it. And it did go down in the Senate. But they\u2019re going to keep trying. There\u2019s only two issues that I really would get out there [ 00: 40: 00] again and go to jail for again; one of them is the nuclear issue, and the other is the draft. Do you foresee them making the test site active again? I know there\u2019s been talk. I do. I really do. And at some time in the next four years. The troops are sparse. They\u2019re going to want something that\u2019s really, really bad. It seems like you\u2019ve been politically active\u2014 you\u2019re just a politically active person. Yeah, but more though in the last ten years probably. What other things have you been involved in? I mean this seems like something of pretty great magnitude. I\u2019ve never protested or done anything like that before. I\u2019ve written letters and made phone calls on various things: the environment, high- rise buildings on the beach, you know, all those kinds UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 16 of things. And then after I\u2019d been in jail this time, then it was easier. I mean we protested Nike, we protested The Gap, we\u2019ve been arrested and then let go. We protested the Iraq War and did eight days in the Twin Towers [ Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Correctional Facility] for that. Oh, wow. Yeah, that was really an experience. And that\u2019s here in L. A.? Yes. We also protested at the federal building and we got arrested by the federals. They would not put us in jail, Jim and I, because we had too much money in the bank. We weren\u2019t like the other Catholic Workers who have zip. So they fined us. They put us on probation. We have two more years to go. And they fined us thirty- five hundred dollars. And this was for standing with a sign, not moving, saying a prayer, not in anybody\u2019s way, not blocking a doorway\u2014 This was in L. A. at the federal building? In L. A. The federal building downtown. I mean it was strictly within our rights. This paper has both of our statements to the judge which, as Jim said in his and I echoed it in mine, that a right that when exercised is punished, is no right. There were no signs in there saying that you could not stand there. Right. And this was based on what, being on private property? Being on their property. They told us to leave and we didn\u2019t. But you know people were there all day long. It just happened to be because we were carrying a sign. People sit there and eat their lunch but they don\u2019t bother them. Right. The act of protest has changed. And they\u2019re all in their SWAT things. So I think it\u2019s only going to get worse. It seems to be getting more punitive. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 17 Makes you wonder how that\u2019s going to actually impact the act of protest. Something like going out to the test site, even. It\u2019ll be interesting. The federal government did not get involved with ours. It was the State of Nevada, because that periphery fence is on, supposedly, Nevada. So the federal government did not get involved. Now if we could figure out a way to get into Mercury then it would be federal. Right. And it probably would have looked like a very different scene had the federal government gotten involved, I would imagine. It\u2019s hard to say whether it would\u2019ve been more or less, but due to the damage, people have [ 00: 45: 00] gotten six months for just crossing the line at Fort Benning [ Georgia, School of the Americas]. So because we did damage it could\u2019ve been more. Given your experience, would you do it again? Yeah. I think at this point I would have to have an excuse, more of a\u2014 if they started testing weapons out there again, then I think I would. You mentioned a little earlier that you had kids. Yes. How many kids do you have? I have five, two men and three women now, and they range from forty- eight to forty. Every two years. Very close in age. And then we have eight grandchildren, ranging from three to twenty- two. That\u2019s quite a range. What do they think about your involvement, and are they politically active at all? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 18 Our daughter that is forty- one\u2014 forty- two, she\u2019ll be forty- two in December, teaches\u2014 is a professor at Soka University. She finished her dissertation she started three or four years ago. It was on nations and how they\u2019re perceived by the way the media presents them. The nations she was working with were North Korea, Iraq, those two mostly, and think there was one more but I can\u2019t think of what it is. She\u2019s teaching political science but she also has a lot of non- nuclear stuff in there. She has a lot of foreign students, a large amount of Japanese, and she has spent some time in Japan and has visited Hiroshima. So I would say that she is politically active. The textbook she\u2019s using has a forward in it by Phil Berrigan. So she\u2019s very much. The other daughter who\u2019s forty- four is getting her teaching certificate. But she has protested with us at some of the marches, but what she prefers, she is very interested in the children that are being left behind in the \u201c No Child Left Behind\u201d project; children that there\u2019s no way that they can keep up. She\u2019s very good with troubled children. The youngest who is forty was so appalled that I was in jail, she couldn\u2019t even write me a letter. Jennifer, the one who\u2019s the teacher, came to see me. Jocelyn was in Washington State at that time, so she couldn\u2019t. But she wrote and her children wrote. And the two men, they would take a phone call if I called them but they\u2014 one wrote one letter, but the other one didn\u2019t. I think that they were just horrified that we were in jail. They were worried about us, and just really didn\u2019t know what to do. Jim, bless his heart, drove from Oakland once a month to visit me. My father had me phone him once a week. And I have to say he is definitely not\u2014 he\u2019s definitely a right- wing Republican, but my being his daughter superseded that. He at least, I think, wanted to know if I was doing OK. We lost a lot of friends. My sister and my brother were very angry and didn\u2019t want to talk about it. They didn\u2019t write\u2014 UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 19 Do you think because of the actual physically being in jail or the whole circumstance, the being out at the test site and the\u2014 I think my sister thought it was just an awful thing to break the law. My brother was not [ 00: 50: 00] quite that adamant. My brother had been in Vietnam and I just don\u2019t talk to him about the whole peace movement. He can\u2019t handle it. For him to admit that his government put them all in harm\u2019s way for no reason and are doing it again, he can\u2019t deal with that. It\u2019s just too painful. So he has to pretend that they\u2019re OK. I have another friend that I\u2019ve known for fifty years and she has made me promise\u2014 well, I told her I wouldn\u2019t promise but she tries to get me to promise that I will never do that again. They don\u2019t really quite understand. What you were doing, and why. Yeah. Well, it\u2019s a lot of personal dedication and conviction, which I think people don\u2019t [ understand] unless they have something that they can relate that to. The funny thing is that I heard from some friends when we were getting ready for our fiftieth high school reunion, and had mentioned to them that I couldn\u2019t come because I was going to be in jail at that time. Then one thing led to another as far as explanations and they found my\u2014 one of them had put in Joyce Parkhurst in the Google and up came my rap sheet. And I got several phone calls from people I hadn\u2019t seen in fifty years saying good for you. So you never know. I had a question sort of unrelated but I\u2019m wondering if\u2014 I\u2019ve had people tell me that they remember being able to see some of the clouds and the bright lights, when they used to do shots out at the test site, from California. I\u2019m wondering if you ever\u2014 UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 20 You know, I don\u2019t remember anything like that. I really don\u2019t. I remember things from during the Second World War but I don\u2019t remember that. I think we\u2019re just too bright, maybe. And it sounds like, too, you were headed toward Wisconsin at that time for part of it, as well. I think maybe if you were up higher, too. Yeah, that could be, because I guess these folks were closer to northern California. But I just thought well, that\u2019s really a powerful blast. That would be pretty scary. So are there any other thoughts or stories or related stories that you feel are important? I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll think of things after you stop, but I can\u2019t think of anything right now. Do you have plans to go next summer to the [ test site]\u2014? Probably. Is that something you\u2019re going to continue? Yeah, we like to go on that weekend. It\u2019s meaningful to us partly because one of our friends, Ladon Sheats was very involved in that and he died on the seventh of August, so it\u2019s a kind of a memorial for him as well. But I remember it every year. I always have remembered it every year. I can\u2019t remember a year since I was a child that I did not remember the people of Japan on that day. It\u2019s just part of me. Right. Well, as you mentioned, it was significant in your mom\u2019s life as well. Yeah. Were both your parents fairly conservative? Yes. I think my mother, if she had been\u2014 you have to understand the times. My mother was kind of under my father\u2019s thumb to a certain extent, and I think my mother on her own, left to her own devices, would have been much more liberal. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 21 So it\u2019s interesting that you took the opposite route. Yeah. I think where I am, I think that\u2019s the way she was when she was younger. And my brother and my sister didn\u2019t get quite as much of that input, so they didn\u2019t come out the same [ 00: 55: 00] way. We\u2019re polar opposites, really. Yeah, often is in families. I always find that interesting. Yeah, Jim and his brother, same way. So you\u2019re here in California now through the winter? Yes. And then you\u2019re heading back to your cabin? Yeah, hopefully next April. I definitely appreciate you taking the time to do this and to tell your story. It\u2019s very interesting. Oh, it\u2019s a pleasure. Probably just because of your timing, you don\u2019t have a chance to meet folks that actually work out at the test site, I\u2019m imagining. No. And of course there\u2019s only a couple thousand people that are still employed there, but just wondering what you think. I mean do you have any animosity toward them, or maybe \u201c animosity\u201d isn\u2019t the correct word\u2014 Really, my animosity is more towards the government that does this. I understand people have to make a living, but I would hope that they would think about it. Right. I mean I can\u2019t make a judgment on what somebody has to do. Right. Well, and especially for Nevada. At one point it was such a huge employer for people. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 22 Yeah. But just curious, you know. So, all right, if you think of anything else that pertains to this, let me know. Otherwise I certainly appreciate you taking the time, especially on a holiday weekend. I\u2019m glad to. I don\u2019t mind. I don\u2019t know if you can use this. This is something I wrote while I was in jail. It may be too religious but it\u2019s kind of like a meditation. Can I keep this stuff? Oh, yes, you can keep that. And this one is a\u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re interested in the jail time in Los Angeles. Sure. This was an article. I can give you the whole paper, but this \u201c Tired, Cold, and Hungry\u201d is my story of what it was like to be in jail in Los Angeles. How long have you been involved with the Catholic Worker? I worked with the Catholic Worker in the mid- eighties. I worked in their clinic for a year. I went every Friday and helped them out, and then my\u2014 In their clinic? Downtown L. A. And then my grandchildren started coming and so I was doing pretty full- time babysitting so my daughters\u2014 because they were single parents\u2014 could go to work. So when we retired, Jim was looking around particularly for some place to go. In \u2019 95 he went to stay with the Catholic Worker for a month, and then he began going from the ranch to L. A. for two weeks every month to stay with them. And after about a year of that, I started going. That\u2019s when we began to realize that it was sort of silly for us to be running up and down Highway 395\u2014 somebody wanted to use it [ the ranch] for a halfway house, so we turned it over to them. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 23 So you became involved with them on a, I don\u2019t want to say you stumbled into it, but it was a less overt. Yes, he chose it because I had been associated with them, and partly because we began getting their Agitator and it really sparked our interest and it made sense. Yeah, which is good. Well, again, thank you. Well, you\u2019re welcome. Did you want to take this one, too? [ 01: 00: 00] Sure. Yes. You may not be able to use it, but I have a bunch of these, so you\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdre welcome to them. OK, if you have a bunch and you can spare one, that would be great.

Campbell January 31, 2006 in Las Vegas, NV Conducted by Charlie Deitrich [ 00: 00: 00] Begin Track 2, Disc 1. Charlie Deitrich: I just wanted first of all to say thanks, and you\u2019re going to run us basically through the beginning to the end of an event, the Distant Zenith event [ 0919/ 1991]. John Campbell: [ A] nuclear test, the nuclear weapons test, and it was for Defense Nuclear Agency [ DNA] which was a DoD, Department of Defense [ test], and that\u2019s where our funding came through. And I worked for Reynolds Electric and Engineering [ REECo] and their parent company was EG it\u2019s when\u2014 The second they push the red button. Oh, that is zero time? That\u2019s zero. OK. And then there\u2019s some time between zero time and when you collect all the data and whatnot. We call it X- minus- eighteen months, just like you were counting down, that\u2019s the way they do it. When it gets down to minus- ten minutes and then they get right down and then they count down the last twenty seconds, fifteen, ten, nine, eight, and all of what\u2019s done is then automatic. The control point must be somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty, twenty- five miles from P Tunnel, and it\u2019s done remotely from about twenty miles away. But there\u2019s cameras everywhere. They\u2019ve got underground\u2014 they even have cameras right on the device, but there are very few people see that. You ever see it? One time. Really. Yes. I got to see two devices while the scientists were hooking them up, doing the wiring and the measuring and whatever they do, their part. They were, what do they call that, device engineers. They would bring it in. But once it went underground through the portal, the responsibility of the men\u2019s safety was my responsibility because I was the mining superintendent, so I would usually be on the team that would walk the flatcar in, pushed by a motor, with the pig on it, and a pig is a UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 7 lead- shielded containment vessel for transportation of the nuclear device. And then they\u2019d take it up to ground zero and there\u2019d be probably a party of about, including security, there\u2019d be, oh, ten, twelve of us that would escort this thing to ground zero, and then they\u2019d have your industrial hygiene and RADSAFE, the radiation technicians, they would check for leaks and this and do their safety checks, and then take the device out of the pig, place it into A Box. And when they took it out of the pig and placed it in the A Box is when I was standing in a position that I could see what went on. And I waited for, what was it, [ 00: 15: 00] twenty- five years to see that. It was kind of disappointing a little bit because, is that all it is? Well, yeah, a twenty- five- year buildup, it\u2019s hard to imagine it not being disappointing. Because very few people got to see it. Very few people got to see it. Well, I knew that some of the scientists and the DoD people, your test engineers, because DNA, or Defense Nuclear Agency, was our main customer. It\u2019s got a new name now. They\u2019ve renamed that. Something to do with weapons. I\u2019ve heard it a couple of times [ Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)]. So to go back to kind of march through our chronology here, when you say \u201c field experiments,\u201d that means actually putting the experiments into the field? Yes. You weren\u2019t a part of the process of choosing the experiments. You were the people that somebody said, \u201c we want to do this,\u201d and you make it happen. And we did it. The scientists would come to us with the impossible. They\u2019d want to put a ten- foot plug in a nine- foot hole. Really! And we did it. This is again at T Tunnel, they brought in a hunk of granite, probably weighed ten, twenty ton. Huge. And it was the exact same size as our drift that we drove. And there was a place where they had drilled them holes. And this was a huge piece of granite, you know, three times the size of a car, and they had strategically placed UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 8 holes in this and holes all the way through, part of it was polished to high polish on it, it was shaped really weird, and that was put in ground zero and then all the experiment line- of- sight pipes were hooked up. And what that was for, I never did ever find out what it was for, but that\u2019s what they would do, the scientists. Sometimes we weren\u2019t on the same page; they were in their own little world. But they knew that we would get it done for them. Somehow, someway, we got that thing in that. It took us four or five days, but we got it back in that and placed into that tunnel. And correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but it seems like your job was to get on their page, or to make their page\u2014 Fit ours. Yes. They already had theirs. Theirs was set in concrete or, you know, it was written in\u2014 so we had to figure out a way to accommodate that. I don\u2019t know if we mentioned this yet, but what year was [ Distant] Zenith? Do you remember? I can find out. Let\u2019s see if I can see the\u2014 Distant Zenith. Let\u2019s see if I can find it. [ Sound of pages turning] If you\u2019re looking for that, I guess\u2014 I didn\u2019t want to break you from your chronology. Oh, that\u2019s all right. Distant Zenith, September 19, \u2019 91. And so the eighteen- month thing, you found out, what, early summer, late spring of\u2014 We probably knew they were going to do at least three events at P Tunnel when they first started it. We knew that we had at least three test beds to do, so it was, oh, we knew in plenty of time to get ready for the Distant Zenith, because it wasn\u2019t the first one that we did. I think Disko Elm was one of the first we did at P Tunnel. Again, I\u2019d have to go back and make sure because there were about five events that we did at P Tunnel. At N Tunnel there\u2019s must\u2019ve been\u2014 because that went on for forty years. I mean it, oh, no, since 1958. They worked underground at N Tunnel UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 9 [ 00: 20: 00] forever. And I was one of the last human beings out of the old part of the tunnel. Now it\u2019s full of water. I was still employed there when they\u2014 we called it \u201c button it up.\u201d They removed as much hazardous material as they could from the tunnel and all them miles and miles and miles, literally miles of drift that was in that mountain, they went out with big containment plugs, closed the doors, and turned the pumps off and virtually turned all of the power off underground. So you literally were one of the guys that turned out the lights as you left. I was the one that called the department office and got permission to call Dispatch and turn the power off at N Tunnel. It\u2019s kind of like putting an old friend to sleep, because I\u2019d worked there fifteen years and had supported my family fifteen years with that tunnel. So I got to be there at the last, and there was no big fanfare, nothing. I just walked over to the telephone and called Chris Evans, the dispatcher in charge of Electrical, and I said, Shut her down. And so they got the lineman out and shut all the power to the transformers off, and she went to sleep. Started filling full of water. And that was ten years ago, so there\u2019s a lot of water in that mountain right today. In fact. OK, so where were we in our\u2014? Well, I\u2019ll just read some of the statistics from this Distant Zenith, and the amount of tunneling that was done, there was about 4,450 foot of tunnel. It was began October \u2019 89 and completed June \u2019 90, the mining was completed. [ Reading from Distant Zenith statistic sheet]. [ 00: 22: 02] End Track 2, Disc 1. [ 00: 00: 00] Begin Track 3, Disc 1. And we\u2019re back. OK, where\u2019d we leave off at? Tunneling? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 10 Yes. [ Reading from Distant Zenith statistic sheet]. There was about 4,450 foot of tunnel. We began mining in October of \u2019 89 and completed mining in June 1990. And the overburden or the ground cover over ground zero was 880 feet. Ground zero, distance from portal, 4,900 feet. Amount of earth removed, 29,496 cubic yards. Line- of- sight pipe, 800 foot long, diameter from six inches to twelve foot. The event bag, which was a nylon type of material that they filled full of exotic gases, it was 550 foot long. What\u2019s that for, again? They filled it full of several exotic gases. For what, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know exactly what they were after by filling it full of gas. And the diameter was fifteen- and- a- half foot to twenty foot. Volume, 138,300 cubic feet. And they filled this full of gas and I\u2019m not sure what it was for, but it more or less virtually was just a big balloon inside of the tunnel, and it was 550 foot long and they filled it full of these gases. They had bottles and bottles and bottles of different types of gases, and a little bit of this and a little bit of that, and then that was filled up and kept full until zero time. I guess it\u2019s the X- rays or something. I don\u2019t know. Or the EMP, the electromagnetic pulse that comes from off the device when it\u2019s detonated. I never did find out why they did that. And some things I knew better than to ask too much about. And there was 400 miles of cabling, from fiber optic to coax cables, and there was 1,200 channels. The budget was forty- seven million [ dollars]. And that\u2019s just the budget for this. The overall budget I know was bigger than that. The picture was a lot bigger than just here. But the forty- seven million is just the budget for the Distant Zenith test? Project. Yes. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 11 Well, that\u2019s, you know, fifty million is fifty million. And adjusted for inflation nowadays, I mean, you know. How much? What is it? I don\u2019t know, maybe sixty, seventy million now. I bet. Yes, seventy. And we couldn\u2019t afford to do business the way we did today because of safety and the rules on radiation exposure, that has changed tremendously. In fact, we couldn\u2019t do it. The way we used to do it, we couldn\u2019t do it. They don\u2019t have enough money to get it done. Is that good or bad? I\u2019m going to say it\u2019s a little bit of both. It\u2019s bad in one sense because you lose out on the knowledge, but then if they\u2019re tasked to do it a better\u2014 get the same results a better, cheaper, safer way\u2014 and that was one of the things that we were challenged again and again and again was we got to do it cheaper, we\u2019ve got to do it safer\u2014 and usually it was somebody paid for it in blood. It was usually something happened that we had to. We had to clean up our act. Or there would be a leak or something would happen. And that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds how they learned, by doing, because they never knew for sure what was going to happen. In the early days, they didn\u2019t know how big the device was going to be. They just kind of guessed at it, see. Some of them went over yield; some went under yield. And there\u2019s no way they could figure out\u2014 in fact I had one scientist tell me that the device, it has a mind of its own. When it\u2019s first detonated, it goes out, trying to escape, you know, the path of least resistance, and then it goes back in again and comes out again with more power. If you can hold it that time, you got it. It\u2019ll contain itself then. [ 00: 05: 00] OK, so we\u2019re still fairly early in the process, right? Is there anything you want to say about the process of fielding the experiments? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 12 Well, the mining entailed, too, before we could ever field the experiments, the mining had to be completed and there were a lot of plugs, closures, places for closures that. If we had a picture, you could see it better, but for me to explain, in this series of drifts that we\u2019d mined, there had to be places for closures, which would seal the radiation, the debris, everything off from going down the line- of- sight pipe. It had to be done in nanoseconds. And during the mining process, we had to superharden the ground, and that was done with ground support rock bolts that were fully epoxied up to twenty foot long\u2014 twenty- five foot long some of them, twenty- four foot long\u2014 which were fully grouted and they were on four- foot centers. Every four foot in that mile of tunnel or 5,000 foot of tunnel had to be supported so it wouldn\u2019t cave in because of the ground shock that would go through from when you detonated. It would do some funny things. I mean it would turn concrete to water under that much pressure. Concrete would flow just like water. One second ago it was hard, up to so many psi [ pounds per square inch], say twenty thousand psi, and then close to ground zero where some of these containment features were, the concrete, the scientists said it would just flow just like water. I couldn\u2019t figure out how it did it. Yeah, that\u2019s hard for me to wrap my brain around. In fact, if you could get down in 15 Shaft, that was done in granite, at Pile Driver and Hard Hat, those code names. They did it for NORAD [ North American Air Defense Command] over at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado Springs, Colorado. This was a test to see if that communication complex would survive a direct nuclear hit. And they had a round drift, oh, I\u2019d say ten foot in diameter, driven about, oh, eighty feet that I could see. And they lined that drift with concrete and rebar. Rebar was one- inch rebar on about four- inch centers, so it was just a solid mass of rebar and concrete. And when that device went off, it squeezed the tunnel down and took this round cylinder and flattened it. And I dare you to find a crack in that concrete. Now you know UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 13 that if you take a round cylinder of concrete and [ hitting hands together] crush it, it\u2019s going to crack and fracture, but under that pressure and that ground, it didn\u2019t do it. And I used to go take people back there and I\u2019d say, Now, look at this. And you could put water on it, because you can usually see any hairline fractures or something, and I defy you to find a crack in that concrete. How that happened, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just one of the things that under that tremendous amount of pressure, in nanoseconds, just in quick time, it just did some weird things. And other places it just tore it all to billy goat. It did. But in this one particular drift, and it was\u2014 now when they were pointed right at it, they would survive, but when they were crossways, they would destroy it. They know that. So if they\u2019re looking right at the device or at ground zero, the shock waves coming this way, it would survive more so than if it was crossways. If it was crossways, it just wiped it out, like a tsunami. Same thing. It\u2019s much the same kind of energy that you\u2019d get out of a hurricane, a tsunami, tornado. All that huge amount of energy that\u2019s released there in such little places that does weird things. It was. It was mind- boggling to me. And the geologists that did it, they\u2019d shake their head, too, yeah, because you couldn\u2019t second- guess it. You couldn\u2019t get one ahead of them. That was fascinating, but it kept me going, because I [ 00: 10: 00] figured, how in the world would this stuff\u2014? How and why. And in some places it completely failed. Other places it would stand like nothing ever happened. Like you wouldn\u2019t believe that two or I\u2019ll say five hours ago, there was all that energy and electromagnetic pulse and all that stuff was going down the line- of- sight pipe and then five hours later we\u2019re standing there without any protection. Just like nothing happened. No gases, no nothing. That\u2019s how good they got at it. Just like walking back into a laboratory that had a nuclear device go off in it, hours before, five hours before, and we\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdd walk right back in and no reading or nothing. I think Distant Zenith was one of UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 14 them. We went right back in and it was completely clean. Everything worked like they knew what they were doing. So I guess what comes first? Do you mine for ground zero? Is that what it\u2019s called? Yeah, we go all the way to ground zero with both the line- of- sight heading\u2014 that\u2019s where the experiment is\u2014 and then we have what they call a bypass which is driven parallel, about eighty to a hundred feet away parallel, and so when once they field and put in the line- of- sight pipe and then concrete it in, because we\u2019ll pump. Let\u2019s see, concrete and grout in Distant Zenith, there were 10,953 cubic yards of concrete and grout used to seal that tunnel, because you\u2019d put the line- of- sight pipe and that line- of- sight pipe would start at six inches. That\u2019s where the device would go, right here. And then it was like a megaphone. It would go all the way up to twelve foot in diameter. And then they would pump a vacuum on that. It would be down to I don\u2019t know how many microns. It would get right down to simulate outer space. That\u2019s what they were trying to achieve, the same conditions as outer space. Is that on all the tests or this one in particular was supposed to simulate outer space? Most all of them. Most all of them had a line- of- sight pipe in them. Now in the early days back in, oh, the late fifties, they did it many different ways. They were learning. Then once the moratorium [ occurred] where they had to contain them and they had to go underground, they did things a lot different. Had to. OK. So you start at ground zero with the line- of- sight pipe, and then kind of describe to me what the process is to field the experiments once you have ground zero and the line- of- sight pipe. Well, the places for the experiments were designed when they assembled the line- of- sight pipe, usually in Spokane, Washington. That\u2019s where they made a lot of the line- of- sight for the test site was then in Spokane, by Boeing. And they would ship it to the test site. And in the pipe were UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 15 certain grids and brackets and things that are already put in there, strategically put in certain construction stations, and once that was in and cemented up to the end of the pipe to contain it, then there were doors, much like pressure hatches. You would open that door up and scientists could go in and then they\u2019d hang a warhead, a regular end of a warhead, they would hang them in the pipe, with the device in it. They even did that one time. They hung a live device inside of a warhead inside the pipe, because they wanted that shine to hit the warhead, because it does something to it. They disarm them. It disarms them. That\u2019s why they wanted, with the MX [ missile experimental] system, if they did have a, say a submarine launched a missile into outer space or it come off of a satellite. They had missiles and warheads in satellites. They\u2019d deploy ten at once, you know, just from wherever. And they could get close to that satellite and detonate a device and the shine from it would disarm it. Something in the circuit worked the electromagnetic pulse, and again this is way over my head but that\u2019s what they were trying to achieve. Well, if it was over your head, it\u2019s a mile over mine. So with the line- of- sight pipe, is there only one line- of- sight pipe? Note: Photographs and diagrams Mr. Campbell refers to are from The Containment of Underground Nuclear Explosions, U. S. Congress, Office of Technical Assessment, OTA- ISC- 414, GOP, October 1989. Page numbers indicate explanatory images. [ 00: 15: 00] The line- of- sight drift and a line- of- sight pipe\u2014 well, here, that shows you. See, there\u2019s the tunnel, see, and this is a piece of line- of- sight pipe. [ pp. 22, 23] It had to come in in sections, and then the pipe fitters had to weld it all together, see, and then we would go and build bulkheads every so many feet and actually fill the whole annulus or the radius around there full of concrete. So you\u2019d only have the pipe itself open on the inside, and that was open all the way to ground zero. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 16 So you have a ground zero, you have the pipe, and then whatever part of the tunnel, the distance between the tunnel and the pipe would be concreted in. Yes. Because here\u2019s the edge of the tunnel. Now here\u2019s one of your experiment stations. See all the little places for\u2014? And this would be built and\u2014 And that\u2019s the cross- section of a line- of- sight pipe? That\u2019s a cross- section of a line- of- sight pipe, and all these places were for experiments, all the way around these things, and there were several places. There\u2019s one there in the middle, up here [ p. 24]. And there were different ones, different kinds of them like that. Let me see if I can find a place here where it shows more of a line- of- sight. Yes, here\u2019s the portal, see, and there\u2019s one event, two events, three, four. There were four. That\u2019s at P Tunnel. And then there was one more off over here, and the new ones they did is off over here. It Y- ed off right in here by the old walker shack and went out that way. But on the tunnel entrance, there\u2019s a huge door about 1,700 foot in. They call it a gas- sealed door. That\u2019s metal. That swings into place, and the only way you can get back in the tunnel is to open a little hatch and crawl in until during reentry, then they\u2019ll take a crew of people and go in there and open this big, huge door back up. I mean it\u2019s inch- thick metal and it\u2019s a gas- sealed door. It seals all the gases back in. That\u2019s what it\u2019s for. There are several of these along the way. There\u2019s one here. There\u2019s one there. So you got the gas- sealed door, you got the gas- sealed plug, and then you got your overburden plugs and stuff back in here. But see, this here was the line- of- sight drift. See this straight drift right here? That was line- of- sight. This other one parallel to it was called the bypass. Ground zero would be right here. So once this is concreted- in with all this pipe in it, going out to about here, right in there, then these crosscuts in here, scientists can come up here and go over there and get in the pipe through a big door. [ Sound of pages turning] Those are some of the closures. There\u2019s a FAC, UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 17 fast- acting closure. [ p. 44, Figure 3- 7, c] This is part of the line- of- sight, but you\u2019re getting real close to ground zero because that\u2019s probably only about two- and- a- half, three foot in diameter. This is about seven foot from here to here. That\u2019s about a ten- by- ten drift. See the rock bolts that hold the ground and the wire mesh? [ p. 47] I\u2019ve got a picture that can really\u2014 What was the main goal for the Distant Zenith test? Ooh, I bet you that one\u2019s classified. I bet you why they were doing that was classified. It was part of a program. [ p. 21, image and text scrambled], A lot of it had to do with communications, I know that, and it had to do with getting more channels out of the fiber optic, because fiber optic was fairly new yet and they were getting more and more channels from fiber optic, where they used to take a whole bundle of coax, it was that big around. The cables were, oh, half- inch to three- quarters of an inch in diameter, and there would be miles of them, literally just several miles, and then they replaced all that with fiber optic back in the eighties. And I can remember the first fiber optic cable. Man, they treated it like gold. Well, it was. It was more expensive than gold. And then mostly what it all is now, or in the latter years, it was most all fiber optic that they got their [ 00: 20: 00] information out of, and it was a lot clearer and more channels and a lot less chance of cable damage. Because that was our lifeblood, it was the cables, so we had to protect them, oh, all the time. Pardon me if I\u2019m being redundant, but I\u2019m trying to wrap my brain around all this. So the first thing you do, is it the right terminology to say you tunnel in, create the test bed where the device goes, and then what comes next is you put the line- of- sight pipe in? Yeah, once the mining is completed and all the ground hardening, ground support is done\u2014 And that\u2019s where the rock- bolting comes in? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 18 That\u2019s the rock- bolting and concreting. Then we start to concrete and grout. Grout, again, to seal any fissures or any watercourses that were in the mountain, that we\u2019d have to seal them off, and if there was any water leaking, they would try to seal off as much water as they could, because water can cause you to have problems with secondary explosions, because of the steam. That tremendous amount of heat would cause a secondary explosion from water, and that caused them lots of misery in the early days. Some of the areas of Rainier Mesa have more water than others. T Tunnel was the worst. It had more water in it. E Tunnel and T Tunnel. A lot of water. But like I said, once the mining was done and the line- of- sight pipe was installed, then would come your scientists and they would start to what we call field their recording stations and all of the instruments that went in and experiments that went inside the pipe would be installed. And then they would run several dry runs on the cabling, like full- system dry runs, so they\u2019d start down a five- hour countdown where all the scientists would make sure all the little cables and all the idiosyncrasies that they had going on and little magic experiments that they had [ been] playing with, that once they got them where they were happy or they could meet, again the Containment Panel and the Evaluation Panels would say all right. After they had a dry run, they\u2019d have a meeting and say, All right, well, we\u2019ve got problems here, here, and here, and they\u2019d work on them, and then once they got a good dry run, then they would give us the OK to insert, and that\u2019s when they\u2019d bring the device up, because she\u2019s all ready to go, and then the device goes into ground zero. How does the device get into ground zero? Is that through the bypass? Yeah, we\u2019d go down the bypass. See, because it goes all the way to the portal. Because the rest of it\u2019s full of concrete. [ p. 67] And the other thing is, did you play any role in fielding the experiments in the line- of- sight pipe? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 19 We supported. Our pipe fitters, our carpenters, our craftsmen supported the scientists. Whatever they needed, we were there to support them, putting them in, but they would do most of the tech work themselves. We had electricians and pipe fitters that would help them that were kind of specialists, trained. They would help the scientists. But mostly they\u2019d bring their own people to do it. Sandia, Lawrence Livermore, who were some of the other ones? Los Alamos, Jaycor. There must\u2019ve been at least twenty agencies. If there\u2019s an eighteen- month from the time you get the go- ahead to the time of the actual event\u2014 Well, now, there was the event and then reentry [ that] was eighteen months. That was from beginning to end. I mean how long does each of these steps take? Like how long would it take for you guys to kind of get to where you\u2019ve created the test bed? Right at about a year. That takes a year to tunnel in there and do that? To get all the things ready for fielding. Fielding is when the scientists come in. OK. So that takes a year. A year, to do the mining and construction and concreting. Wow. This might be a dumb question but how is it that the tunnel didn\u2019t collapse on you guys? [ 00: 25: 00] Because of the hardening, the ground, the rock- bolt supports. So as you go, you\u2019re doing it? Yes. And then we come back later and do some more. We can advance the tunnel so you can get all the mining done. And then we\u2019d come back in and set up big rock drills. And they\u2019d drill and just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of rock bolts would go out into the ground twenty- four foot and then they\u2019d put a plate on it, a big, huge rock- bolt plate. And they would torque it up UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 20 and it\u2019d pull that ground together, just a like a bolt would on a car, you know, it pulls that ground together, so when the ground force does hit it, it all goes together. It doesn\u2019t wiggle and fall in. It moves together, kind of like it was one piece. Yes, I got you. That\u2019s why if I would\u2019ve had any way to do it, I would\u2019ve taken a camera out there more to record some of the things. A lot of people, you know, you could talk for a week and it\u2019s hard to get through to them how you did it, without having pictures and actual\u2014 and I know that DNA has got video pictures of the actual Alpine \u2122 mining and different sequences that we did. What were some of the challenging things about that first year of the process of actually tunneling in and getting to the test bed? [ Telephone rings] [ 00: 27: 39] End Track 3, Disc 1. [ 00: 00: 00] Begin Track 4, Disc 1. Well, so why don\u2019t you talk a little bit about what your role in the actual mining part, the first year. What were some of the challenges? What was your responsibility? Well, when I was superintendent, you had to coordinate usually three shifts. They had a graveyard and a day shift and then swing shift. So we mined continuously. We always had, from Sunday night till Friday night, we had a crew working underground, mining. Probably a crew of men, oh, somewhere around thirty- five; with all your support electricians and radiation monitors and safety people, we had about thirty- five people to the crew on the back shifts. On day shifts we always had a bigger crew, had more pickup drivers, because everybody had a pickup out there. You\u2019d think that there were 5,000 people working that one job, but no, it\u2019s because there\u2019s a hundred pickups outside, that\u2019s about how many people you\u2019ve got. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 21 Some of the challenges were\u2014 the biggest challenge we had as mining was the safety and the paying attention to detail as far as the size of drift, because the scientists were real particular about, especially in areas close to ground zero, that if it called for a five- by- seven, that\u2019s what they wanted. They wanted it within plus or minus a quarter of an inch. That\u2019s tough to mine. You almost can\u2019t do it with dynamite, but you can with an Alpine \u2122 . You can get it within a couple of inches, but then in places we\u2019d have to do it by hand. We\u2019d have to actually mine through that rock with air spaders, chipping gun, and you\u2019d drive or advance your heading for about, oh, twelve, thirteen feet, because it was that critical. Right off of ground zero. You have to be right in there, because it was a containment. And I once found out why, and I don\u2019t\u2014 it was out at, if I can remember, I went to a meeting down there [ DNA}, and I never could figure out why near ground zero would it matter, but here was your line- of- sight pipe [ p. 45]. And this area right, say, from here to the device was here [ p. 45]. When it went off, this area right here, they knew it was going to fail, most of it\u2019s going to be vaporized. The pipe would actually\u2014 Everything. They knew that the pipe closest to the device would fail. The ground and\u2014 yes. You\u2019re right in here [ p. 46], which is going to be nothing but vaporized, and it\u2019s going to leave a cavity, one that it\u2019ll cave in later. But the reason that this drift right in there had to be exactly what they said, because in the end, after, and they found this out through shock waves, it resembled a woman\u2019s breast. So from here to right there, they knew it was going to fail. If they kept this drift exactly the size they called for, the scientists, then the rest of this energy would be dissipated up and out around. But they had to hold it right in there. And then right down here was your first closure, your FAC, fast- acting closure, and then they had closures, UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 22 your MAC [ modified auxiliary closure] and GSAC [ gas seal auxiliary closure] and your TAPS, tunnel and pipe seal. Those are doors that would close within nanoseconds after the device went off. But this right here, the containment right there, Joe LaComb had it drawn on a board, and Byron Ristvet and those people, they had it, it resembled a woman\u2019s breast. And that\u2019s why he said it had, you guys, we\u2019ve got to be right on the money for about twenty feet right in here. Would the tunnel kind of do that shape, too, or would you just kind of go in and then have the\u2014? [ 00: 05: 00] No, it would start out down here. You\u2019d have about a, oh, five- by- seven where you could walk through it, you know, you wouldn\u2019t have much clearance, about, oh, that wide [ indicating width], and then it would megaphone out up to an eighteen- by- eighteen, sixteen- by- sixteen, according to how big a pipe and what they was going to put in it, determined the size of the drift, each line- of- sight pipe. I know that I\u2019ve got pictures somewhere in there that has good pictures of line- of- sight pipe already installed, where you can see in the pipe and look down it. But it was all just graduated up and over, what, Distant Zenith was 800 feet? Yes, LOS [ line- of- sight] pipe, 800 foot long. So it started out at six inches in diameter and went to twelve feet. Six inches in diameter was ground zero. That\u2019s where they put the device right in front of it. How big is the device? The one I\u2019ve seen was not as big as a basketball but close. Maybe a volleyball? Yes, a small volleyball. Then it just looked like somebody had taken a shiny ball with a bunch of little gadgets hung on it here and there, and they put it in there on a rack, and then they had to adjust it right in. They had little, fine adjustments where they could get her perfect, wherever it had to be. There were two parts to it, A and B. It\u2019s much like a piece of pie. That\u2019s how the scientists explained it to me. Here\u2019s your device [ drawing]. It\u2019s stable here. Take this piece of pie UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 23 out, it becomes unstable, and you bring her back in, it comes critical. And they do that with electricity and maybe a, well, I don\u2019t want to use dynamite, but an explosive, to bring that together. Once it comes together, it becomes critical mass and goes. It\u2019s just like a pie. You got a piece of pie and it\u2019s OK there, but you pull that piece of pie out and it becomes unstable, and you shove her back together and it comes critical. And so you saw the Distant Zenith device, or was that a different test? No, I saw Distant Zenith. OK. And that\u2019s the size of a shiny volleyball, essentially. Is it megatons? Kilotons. A megaton is a million times that TNT. I\u2019m going to guess somewhere around five. I think in one of the books it\u2019ll tell you. There is one of the containment books like this, it\u2019ll tell you [ less than 20 kt]. Yes, I think I have one of those somewhere. It\u2019ll tell you the size of the device, the kiloton, the yield. Let\u2019s see, let me look here. OK, here\u2019s Anchovy. Depth of barrow, purpose, yield, low, so it didn\u2019t tell you yield. Twenty to a hundred and fifty kiloton? Let me see. [ Sound of pages turning] Let\u2019s find some of the tunnel ones. Disko Elm. OK, this was P Tunnel. Less than 20 kt [ kilotons]. Weapons Effect. Depth of barrow, 875. Sponsor, DoD/ LLNL, Lawrence Livermore Nuclear Lab. NTS, U12p. 03. That means Area 12, P Tunnel, 03 Drift. [ 00: 09: 14] End Track 4, Disc 1. [ 00: 00: 00] Begin Track 5, Disc 1. What comes first, digging the line- of- sight tunnel or the bypass, or both at the same time? Both. Same time. You usually have two different crews, a bypass crew and a line- of- sight crew. And what do you call the thing that\u2019s to go from the bypass tunnel to the\u2014? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 24 Crosscut. Those are crosscuts. OK. Crosscut 1, 2, or\u2014 if you look at a detailed map, it\u2019ll tell you, and then in some of those pictures I gave you, there is a detailed map of Crosscut 1, 2. And some of them we have to\u2014 let\u2019s see if I can find [ pages turning], we have to take some of the closures in like a FAC and a GSAC let\u2019s see, I thought I\u2019d seen a picture here [ p. 67]. Are the crosscuts dug at the same time as the bypass, or do you come back later and do that? Usually we would do most of the mining as we go in, see. We usually task one group to go right straight ahead and of course the drift gets smaller. And then the bypass crew will come in and when they get to these [ indicating on diagram [ p. 67]], they\u2019ll mine them through. Because we can have crews working ahead up in here, see, and you can have a crew in there doing some task, rock- bolting. Now when it comes to muck removal, then you\u2019ve got a problem with congestion. Are you mining, digging the crosscuts from the bypass to the other tunnel or from the main tunnel to the bypass? Either way. Doesn\u2019t matter? Doesn\u2019t matter. Yes, it\u2019s whichever comes first and how bad they need it. Yes. But see, like, where these drifts are curved somewhat from the bypass over here to the\u2014 like that [ p. 47]? Those are accesses to bring in late- time closures. Because the FAC, this one here, that\u2019s what makes it closed. Can you read that? It says, \u201c Danger, high explosives.\u201d That\u2019s a sheet of explosive material. Have you ever seen composition C or\u2014? Like plastic\u2014? Same. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 25 OK. Plastic explosives. This is a sheet of plastic explosive. And that\u2019s what makes the door close? It\u2019s wrapped all the way around this pipe, and inside here is a certain kind of copper metal that\u2019s pliable and it\u2019ll seal off. It\u2019ll just squeeze it right down to nothing. When that goes off, of course this is filled full of concrete after this is done, but they have to come in and arm this at late time. The device goes in, then they got to come in and one of the things they\u2019ll do is arm this, because they have this high- explosive blanket in there plus the high- explosive det [ detonation]. Did you say \u201c late time\u201d? Well, what I mean by \u201c late time\u201d is after they insert the device, once the device is inserted, then it kind of changes the picture of everything we do. OK, that\u2019s late time, from the time that\u2014 Once they insert the device, insertion, from then we\u2019ll start stemming at ground zero right then, usually sandbags first so in case there\u2019s a grout leak or a concrete leak, it won\u2019t get back in and destroy the project. Because we\u2019ve had problems in the past where grout did leak into a box, and so we have to be really careful about making sure that we don\u2019t. And they\u2019ve got cameras; they can tell exactly when and what\u2019s happening in A Box. Because they\u2019ve got two security guards camped on top of that device until we\u2014 and once we get the first pour made, then it goes back to you don\u2019t need security except in these places like this where there could be a problem with somebody going in there and not on purpose but things could happen where this explosion could go off, so they have to be careful with this. And so it takes a year to do all the crosscuts, bypass, and\u2014 what\u2019s the name of the big tunnel? LOS. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 26 The line- of- sight tunnel? Line- of- sight. Yes. LOS. [ 00: 05: 00] OK. Then you\u2019re not doing the line- of- sight pipe as you do that? That comes after all of the tunneling is done? After 99 percent of the mining is done, then they\u2019ll start fielding the pipe, or bringing the line- of- sight pipe in. And that is the sign to the craft, the pipe fitters, and miners support them. They bring the pipe in and position it, and then they take a laser beam and line it all up and get her perfect, and then they mount it, and there\u2019s mountings all the way up the tunnel for this pipe to stand on. We bring it in on the rail, take the car, the pipe dollies back out, mount this big line- of- sight pipe on pedestals. Then once it\u2019s filled full of concrete, see, then it\u2019s pretty well in place And the rails, the track is only in the main, the portal tunnel, right? Yes. And most of the track is taken out, especially in the stemming areas. The stemming areas? Stemming is where you concrete. Anyplace where you fill it back full of concrete is a stemming area. End of stemming is where they\u2014 you look on some of your maps, it\u2019ll say \u201c end of stemming.\u201d I don\u2019t have any. Usually I can tell where end of stemming is on\u2014 see, there\u2019s your bypass drift [ indicating on diagram p. 45], your HLOS [ horizontal line of sight]. When the explosion is detonated, radiation travels down the HLOS pipe at the speed of light. These are all the closures, your MAC and GSAC, mechanical closure. MAC is maximum auxiliary closure. GSAC is gas- sealed auxiliary closure. And there\u2019s your end of stemming, a test chamber, end of stemming in the bypass, see, all that black is concrete, and that\u2019s where the end of stemming is. And the same here. Usually end of stemming in the bypass coordinates exactly the same construction station as end of stemming in the line- of- sight. It\u2019s usually real close together. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 27 I would imagine that concreting in the bypass would be one of the last things you do. Last thing. Yes. Is that the absolute last thing you do That\u2019s\u2014 yes. The device is already in there. Because it\u2019s the point of no return, right? Yes, right, that\u2019s the only way you can get in there. The only access you\u2019ve got to get in there is through the bypass. And that bypass is sectioned off in different pours. We might have as many as ten different pours, different types of concrete and different volumes of concrete. But once the first pour is made off of ground zero, then they\u2019re always setting up or getting ready or pouring, for seven days. Usually it takes us about seven days to stem from ground zero to the end of stemming, see, from ground zero here [ indicating on diagram p. 67], because this is already stemmed in or concreted in. All the experiments are in, so at late time\u2014 what \u201c late time\u201d means is anytime after you put the device in is late time, then we\u2019ll start right at ground zero and put in that first containment plug, and it\u2019s usually only about a twenty- or- thirty- yard pour. It ain\u2019t too much. So if we have to go back in and fix a leak or fix a problem, then we still can. But once we start pouring several hundred yards of concrete, you just\u2014 How do you get back through the concrete? Well, you would just mine through it, right? That\u2019s probably easier than normal mining, I would\u2014 no? No, it\u2019s harder. Is it? Yes. Because you\u2019ve got so much metal, rock bolts and different things that interfere with you. Usually what we would do is drive a drift on the outside of it a little bit, another drift on reentry. We would go up as far as we could in the bypass, and then they\u2014 but places we had to follow the UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 28 old drift line again because they had experiments imbedded in the tunnel rib or wall that we had to go by and they\u2019d dig them out later, usually to do with ground motion. [ 00: 10: 00] So they\u2019d have experiments not in the line- of- sight pipe but actually in the\u2014 All over the tunnel. Yes. And would you guys be the ones to put those in there? We would support the users or the experimenters, scientists. They had three names. They called them \u201c users\u201d until the drug culture come about and then they said, no, we can\u2019t use that, no, we can\u2019t use that name, so they called them \u201c experimenters.\u201d Scientists. OK. What was some of the goofy stuff that you saw as experiments? I mean I\u2019ve heard some different stories about the different stuff that was in there. Oh, let\u2019s see, the funniest\u2014 the one that was, they brought a gun barrel off of a Navy ship, one of the big gun barrels. Like a sixteen- inch off of a battleship? Yes. Yes. They took it underground on flatcars. And it was hush- hush about what was going [ on]. And they laid it up in the drift. I can\u2019t remember exactly where it went. Frank Solaegui can really tell you about this because he was more or less in charge of it. I was just on the crew and heard the story later. And got to see it. I got to see it and everything. But once they brought the gun barrel after the event, they went in and captured the gun barrel again, brought it out and they tipped it up on one end and a piece of gold about that big around [ indicating size] rolled out of the barrel. It had all kinds of little wires and, you know. But the gun barrel was, I guess, to hold it in place. But the gold was to take the full flash of light, the shine. And they rolled that gold out there and that, oh, that probably had to be\u2014 I\u2019ll bet you it weighed twenty- five, thirty pounds, forty. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 29 The gold? Yes. That\u2019s a hunk of gold big as a grapefruit. Pure gold. With little holes and wires and\u2014 Just a measure of what\u2014 If gold would be a good insulation, I think, or a good conductor, or what temperatures, or would the gold withstand this flash of light without changing in it somehow? Because that pulse does weird things to a lot of materials. The pulse goes clear through the mountain. It\u2019s actually a ray in a way, I believe, the way I understand it, that electromagnetic pulse has a ray that goes with it that will actually go clear through the earth. It leaves a signature that goes clear through the earth. But yet it\u2019s so small, it can go through your body and never touch a cell. That\u2019s hard to believe. The way the scientists explained it, your cells are about that far apart [ indicating distance] and this ray goes clear through your body and never touches anything. Now I can\u2019t go with that one because I feel like I\u2019m solid mass. Yes, I do, too. That\u2019s yet another thing I can\u2019t wrap my mind quite around. Quantum physics. There\u2019s something there. Well, there in Lead, South Dakota, in that gold mine, [ Homestake Gold Mine] they had a tank of\u2014 what do they use for dry- cleaning fluid? That chemical [ perchloroethylene (C2Cl4)]. But the scientist [ Raymond Davis] was measuring rays [ neutrinos] from outer space, and I think in the three or four years that they had that experiment going, they had captured two rays that had gone through\u2014 it was fourteen hundred foot underground, in solid granite, and they had a photographic path of this ray going through that big, huge tank, and it had to have several thousand gallons of this\u2014 well, they use it for dry cleaning clothes. Of all the weird things that they used for. But I read\u2014 I think it was in National Geographic, yes, about some of the rays that hit planet Earth, go clear through the earth and UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 30 never touch anything. Now, how\u2019s that? How can you do that? I don\u2019t know. My mind\u2019s not that objective. Well, yes, you know, I see something like this [ knocking on table] and I go, this is solid, right? I mean here it is. And it isn\u2019t. Not to that. This is getting deep [ laughing]. You know, one of the things that I think surprised me and I would imagine would surprise a lot of people is that these tests, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, they weren\u2019t testing the device, they weren\u2019t going, gee, is this device going to work or how can we make the device better? A lot of them were to see the effects of the device on various things. [ 00: 15: 00] Yes. Communications. Radios. They even took a field command post like they\u2019d use out in the field in the Army or Marines or something, where they had a command post with all the communication equipment in it and stuff, they took one of them underground and set it and actually had it bombarded by the shine. Now would that go in the line- of- sight pipe, or that had its own\u2014? No, that had its own\u2014 yes, had its own place, a ramp, yeah, and in fact that was\u2014 And this was underground they did this? Yes. This was at P Tunnel, too. So would that be like the device is like the hub and then there\u2019s spokes coming off and one of the spokes that the shine goes into was where the\u2014? They would come down smaller line- of- sight pipes. I\u2019m trying to think how\u2014 I saw some of them here [ p. 24]. OK, see, actually this flange would be removed and another piece of pipe would be put on there, and we can go on down the tunnel with it, oh, three or four hundred feet, and they put a Plexiglas cover over it, and at late time that cover, because there\u2019s a vacuum on UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 31 this at zero time, there\u2019s a vacuum on inside this pipe somewhere to simulate outer space, but they\u2019d take these off and of course there would be another piece of pipe going on down and it would be right in front of what they wanted to test. Actually that shine would hit what they wanted to test and that was that field command\u2014 it was like a, oh, it was big as, oh, like a work truck you see these guy go around with like a van almost, not a van but it come off of like a big pickup camper? Small camper shell? Not very big. But that would be a command post for all their communications from outer space and that was, I was trying to think, it was when I first got there or the second shot. I don\u2019t know if it was Disko Elm or Mission Ghost or Mission Cyber. It was either Disko Elm, Mission Ghost, or Mission Cyber. I think Mission Ghost was the first shot, so it would\u2019ve been the second one, which would\u2019ve been Mission Cyber [ 12/ 02/ 1987]. That\u2019s where they had that field command in there. And so there\u2019s almost line- of- sight pipes in the line- of- sight pipe. They come off of it. We only have a couple of minutes, so I\u2019m going to stop this CD and put another one in. OK. [ 00: 18: 17] End Track 5, Disc 1. [ 00: 00: 00] Begin Track 2, Disc 2. I don\u2019t have anything left of mining. [ Sound of pages turning] We covered the containment plugs, the mining of the containment plug. Yes. OK. And there was probably about one, two, three, or four of them in the tunnel complex. It was the gas- sealed plug, so it pretty well defines itself. It was supposed to withstand 1,000 degrees, 1,000 psi for so many minutes. I don\u2019t know exactly the time but I know 1,000 degrees and 1,000 psi, and that\u2019s a lot of psi. That\u2019s a lot of psi. And I don\u2019t think that they\u2019ve ever been tested to see if it did. One, Mighty Oak come the UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 32 closest, and it held except for release of some gases in the atmosphere, but it was contained at the overburden plug, but everything else was lost. Everything back in the test bed area was lost. But the gas- sealed plug and the gas- sealed door did hold. Some gases come out. In fact, you can read about that. There\u2019s a lot of articles about Mighty Oak, T Tunnel. That was the worst one we had. In fact, I think it covers Mighty Oak in here in this book. Let\u2019s see, mine, bypass mine, the gas- sealed door, gas- sealed plugs, and mine the LOS and bypass simultaneously, you know, we\u2019re mining both of them together. And the crosscuts as well. And the crosscuts as needed. Crosscut from LOS to the bypass. Overburden plug, gas- sealed plug, your FAS gate, your MACs, GSAC, TAPS, they\u2019re all acronyms for closures. OK. Have we talked about the FAS gate? Is that just the\u2014? They\u2019re all the same. They\u2019re just different names. The FAS gate was the first acronym for GSAC, and they improved upon them, oh, and so they renamed them. FAC is fast- acting closure. GSAC is gas- sealed auxiliary closure. And then you would have the mechanical closure. TAPS is tunnel and pipe seal. GSAC is gas- sealed auxiliary closure. MAC is mechanical closure. MAC. There\u2019s still another definition for MAC, too. The M. Modified auxiliary closure. MAC. Modified. That was a FAS gate and then they called them a MAC, modified auxiliary closure. TAPS is tunnel and pipe seal. In fact, one of the tasks I had over at Pile Driver, when the scientists from Lawrence Livermore lab come down and we started talking this mining jargon and he was reading our logbook because we have to make a daily entry and we did this and this and this here, and so he tasks us to sit down and do a glossary of all the mining terms so he could understand what we were talking about. And I have that somewhere, but I haven\u2019t been able to find it. I know I\u2019ve got a copy of that. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 33 I think it might be in all that stuff [ donated to UNLV]\u2014 It\u2019s there. If you look in there somewhere. I think I remember seeing that. OK, there is a glossary of mining terms. Well, it\u2019s funny because not only does the test site have a lot of jargon, it has a lot of jargon that doesn\u2019t really speak to one another, like you miners had a jargon, the scientists had a different jargon, and so it wasn\u2019t as if there was another language going on at the test site; it was like the Tower of Babel at the test site, it seems like. [ 00: 05: 00] And each one of your crafts had certain tasks and things that they had their own language for. Like the pipe fitters, you know, they would have things to do inside the pipe that we weren\u2019t involved with a lot. We would go in and help support them if they needed, but most of the time they took their, the pipe fitters, they were\u2014 that was a negotiated deal, union negotiation. That was Baneberry there. I saw that [ Containment of Underground Nuclear Explosions, p. 33]. You were out there for Baneberry? I watched it come out of the ground. I was riding in the back of a van, going to work at Ledoux where U1a shaft is. They still got that going. And yes, I was with, oh, Jack Power, Wally Beaman. About four of them are dead now, five of them. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any of them alive but me. One, two\u2014 Pete Peterson is gone, Wally\u2019s gone, Jack\u2019s gone. Jack Severson is gone. I don\u2019t know of anybody but me that\u2019s still alive. Anyway, we were coming over Control Point Hill, CP they call it, control point, and Baneberry was in Area 2 about, oh, five miles as the crow files. And I was about half asleep. Cecil McMurtry, he\u2019s still alive. There\u2019s only two of us that I know of. And Beaman was sitting in the front seat with Jack, the driver, because we UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 34 carpooled in vans, and he said, Holy mercy, look at that. I rose up out of the back seat and the whole desert floor just started to bubble. I mean huge bubble. And then it just kind of collapsed in on itself and come right straight up, and then this is what you see [ indicating photograph p. 33]. You could see boulders flying through the air, big boulders, big as pickups, flying through the air. See, it didn\u2019t come up at ground zero. Ground zero was over here somewhere. It came up through a crack that intersected the drill hole. That was a drill hole. There wasn\u2019t mining done there. It was all done with a drill hole, forty- eight- inch cased hole, and then they\u2019d drop the device down on a rack with a drill rig. That was different than the way we did it. That must\u2019ve put the fear of God into you when you saw that. Yes. Beaman said, Hell, we\u2019re done for the day. Let\u2019s go to Indian Springs or Cactus Springs where you can get a drink. So that\u2019s where we went, to Cactus Springs. But man, it was pandemonium. There were security guards driving everywhere with their lights on. They didn\u2019t know what to do. They were trying to route people this way. That was in the day where they let people out fairly close to ground zero. And the last day, since Baneberry, there was nobody past Mercury, except for your scientists up in the control point. But there was nobody out in the forward area. Nobody. They swept all the forward area. And forward area would be beyond control point, or actually forward area is beyond Mercury, is called forward area. OK. Well, it seems like that\u2019s how we most often learn lessons is from mistakes. Yes. Hindsight. Yes. Well, so was there anything else you wanted to talk about as far as the mining the first year of the work in a test? Do you want to like maybe describe a typical day for you? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 35 Well, OK, that would be a good point, is to kind of brief\u2014 for safety reason, say we were mining a ten- by- ten drift, which is about one of the normal- sized drifts. We did more ten- by- ten mining, ten high, ten wide, than most of the other sizes. We got bigger than that but not a lot. Most of our mining was done in ten- by- ten, because you could get equipment down it, you could get personnel a lot easier instead of the small drifts. You\u2019ve come in, say, and they would be advancing, either drill and blast or with an Alpine \u2122 miner, a mechanized continuous miner, and you\u2019d advance your heading about, oh, eight feet. At a time you\u2019d mine, oh, about eight foot of [ 00: 10: 00] what they call ahead of wire, the chain link fencing that we use to support the ground, and rock bolts. That Alpine \u2122 miner stuck out about ten to twelve feet, so your operator on the miner was always protected. He was under protected ground at all times. So then he would back that Alpiner out. It was on tracks, electric motors, and he\u2019d back it out. Then we would go in there with jacklegs and miners and drill and install ground support rock bolts and then put the wire mesh up, and that way you could safely mine back. It wasn\u2019t dangerous. You had to be careful, because you could get a ground fall or a slab or something on you, a slab being a piece of rock that would fall on you. Like how far would you go in any given day? Oh, on an average, when everything was going real good, we would average, completed tunnel, about six to seven feet per shift of completed tunnel. Some days you\u2019d do more, some days less, but then I think the average there was about six to seven feet a day. When you\u2019re going with the Alpine \u2122 miner, then you have to back it out in order to\u2014? You only back it out about twenty feet. How fast is this thing? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 36 Real slow. About like, you know, a real slow walk was it was going fast. Yes, it was like a crawler. It crawled on tracks and you could ease it up, but it was a real slow walk, and you can crawl on your hands and knees about as fast as it can go wide open. About the same speed. OK. And this thing, I mean if you\u2019re running on three shifts, this thing is running semi- constantly, then. Yes. You\u2019d probably cut for an hour and a half, two hours, back it out, rock- bolt, hang your utilities, which the utilities would be your vent line to pull the dust out, air and water line, you need water line for fire, and to drill in rock with a rock drill, you need water to suppress the dust. And we needed atomizers on the Alpine \u2122 miner that sprayed because this big head would create a tremendous amount of dust because it just chewed the rock up, the volcanic tuff, and that\u2019s very high in silica, so to control the rock dust and the diesel smoke and all the pollutants that we had underground, we did it through a ventilation system. So whenever you got to the end of a twenty- foot section of pipe, then you had to bring another one in and put it in place, and then they\u2019d take a telescopic piece and shove down it, so when you advance you could pull this out as you go. And then once you got to the end of it, down come another pipe and you put your telescope pipe back in, and then you keep advancing that way. That\u2019s for your ventilation. And then you\u2019d have to carry with you air and water: compressed air to run your jacklegs or your drills, and a lot of your machinery underground is air- driven, a lot of your concrete pumps, the conveyors to them are air- driven, your Moran cars, a Moran car being a car that contained concrete. It was a concrete truck on rail, is what it was, and it had a big air motor to it and you hook a two- inch air hose to it under ninety pounds of compressed air, turn a motor on, and that actually rotated that big barrel with concrete in it, twelve yards of concrete. And that\u2019s how we\u2019d UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 37 take a lot of our concrete underground is on rail, big rail like you see running up and down the Union Pacific, only smaller. And run by air. And run by air. Is that because you don\u2019t want the fumes of\u2014? That, and no gasoline underground. More combustible and stuff? Diesel only, a number- two graded diesel. And then you had to scrub it, run it through, oh, percolate it through water with soap and stuff in it, soda and soap, and they put a\u2014 The diesel fuel you would have to do this? [ 00: 15: 00] Well, the exhaust, see, had to be scrubbed. And then you had to have so many cubic feet per minute of ventilation to meet the OSHA [ Occupational Safety and Health Administration] standards and mine, health, and safety standards. So we were under a lot of [ standards]\u2014 and then our own rules. The government, they had a rule book this thick [ indicating thickness] and of course Reynolds Electric [ REECo], they\u2014 whichever is the safest. Because for many years, no other entity could get out there except for who they wanted. We run our own safety program, and did pretty well. Finally in the eighties, when the Tiger Team\u2014 I don\u2019t know if you ever heard of the Tiger Team that Congress mandated to go around to all the nuclear facilities and inspect them? Oh, they came out and they tore us up. Oh! Because we weren\u2019t living by their standards. They did. It took us, I don\u2019t know how much money it took, which is OK. A lot of it was redundant, I mean because we had all kinds of exotic chemicals, gases, bottles and bottles of helium, hydrogen, all kinds of welding gases, you had epoxies, and all this, and when you take it underground, all kinds, and blasting gas from dynamite when you\u2019d blast UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 38 dynamite, that puts off a heck of a gas and it burns all the oxygen. So you\u2019ve got to maintain your dust level, the level of diesel smoke, because there was a lot of diesel. You get six, seven, oh, we had one, two, three, usually about five motors, maybe six diesel motors. And I mean by \u201c motor\u201d that runs up and down the track, pushing them big twelve- yard Moran cars, or pushing muck cars to haul the dirt out, haul the material in, flatcars. There again, I wish I had some pictures or something to show you of how a tunnel train would be made up, because you had to pull everything. Mostly everything you had to pull in. You couldn\u2019t push a muck train in except for a Moran car, and that\u2019s the only one you could push in. Moran car? \u201c Moran car\u201d being the concrete hauler. They were called Moran cars, I don\u2019t know how\u2014 maybe from the maker? I don\u2019t know who made them. We called them Moran cars. And all they are was a twelve- yard concrete hauler that could actually dump the concrete into a conveyor belt, which would dump it into a pump, which would squirt it back into the pour. Some of the pours would go anywhere five, six, seven hundred yards. If you could pump a Moran car every fifteen minutes, you were doing really good. Everything was going clickety- clickety- click because, you know, you get one of them things off the track and they weight thirty ton. Oh, geez. That\u2019s just what I said, oh, geez. And it\u2019s going to get hard on you. You\u2019re under the gun for time, you know, you\u2019re under the gun. Once they put that device in it, it just\u2014 the thing gets just a little bit\u2014 they screw the old a little tighter. Which, to me, it was a challenge. Yes. Wasn\u2019t it exciting, too, it seems like? Oh, yeah, yeah, you\u2019d get bored once in a while, but not very often. You didn\u2019t have time to get bored. It\u2019s kind of like this place around here, see, it was the same. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 39 What was your title, mining supervisor, mining superintendent? Mining superintendent. How much time did you spend in the tunnels as opposed to an office or something like that? OK, I would get to the job about 7: 30 in the morning. There would usually be the graveyard walking boss, which was my assistant, that was there all night. I just showed up about 7: 30 in the morning on day shift. And I\u2019d talk with him, then I\u2019d usually have a walking boss, which they were assistant superintendents, and there was one or two to each crew, so we\u2019d always have two or, well, not two, we\u2019d have one there all the time. That had to be a salaried supervisor [ 00: 20: 00] underground at all times. So when I get to the job, the graveyard walker would come out and tell me and the day shift walker coming on where they were at, if we were\u2014 OK, you\u2019re rock- bolting here, you\u2019re pouring concrete over here, you\u2019re doing this over here. We\u2019d have several, oh, forty or fifty tasks sometimes going on at the same time in different parts of the tunnel. And then that would be for eight hours, and during the mining part there wasn\u2019t a lot for us to do, I mean as far as directing traffic, because it was repetitious, over and over and over. We just had to make sure that they were on target and had plenty of material because you know you\u2019re 125 miles from anywhere, or 105. From that front door over there to P Tunnel is 105 miles. And you know if you have to run to town to get a handful of bolts, you can\u2019t wait five hours for them to get back, so we had to have quite a warehouse system out there to keep us going. It was quite a storage area. In fact, N Tunnel, when they started demobbing it, there must\u2019ve been fifteen to twenty acres of stuff. Demobbing? Demobilizing? Demobilizing. Yes. We started buttoning up and moving out and they give a lot of the stuff away, barrels and barrels of oil and antifreeze. It was fifteen to twenty acres, say, you take two UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 40 city blocks right here in this neighborhood, and there were all kinds of material on it. Every kind of thing. Sheet metal from this thick to that thick [ indicating thicknesses]. I got pictures somewhere of the lower yard at N Tunnel, and it was probably at least fifteen acres of stuff. Was there one big place that serviced all the different tunnels or was there one per? Most of it came out of Mercury, Warehouse Division, but we had our own people that ordered. They would order what we needed according to what phase of mining we were in. When we were actually doing the mining and construction, we applied a lot of gunite, and I never did ever cover that. That was what covered the tunnel walls with. It\u2019s sprayed on, much like a swimming pool when you gunite a swimming pool or pump the concrete on homes. It would be blown on. You\u2019d blow on about, oh, anywhere from three to six inches of fibercrete or gunite all over the tunnel. Is that after the rock- bolting? After the rock- bolting, yeah. And again, sometimes the hardening came on after that, when you\u2019d harden the tunnel. First you\u2019d go through and support it so it wouldn\u2019t cave in on you. Then you\u2019d gunite it. And then you\u2019d come back and set up them big drills and they\u2019d drill the twenty- four- foot fully- epoxied or full- grouted bolts on three- by- four or four- by- four centers all the way from the invert, which is the floor, all the way around to the other floor. They didn\u2019t harden the bottom too much. Some places they did. Not too much. And the gunite\u2019s purpose, was it to harden the tunnel, was it to diminish dust, was it\u2014? To harden the tunnel, so when on reentry, when you come back in, you don\u2019t have ground fall or cave- in. Because it would, it would really bind everything together. Because that wire mesh or chain link fencing was in there and gunited through that, and that helped it, and the rock bolts helped it. You\u2019d have places where it would ground fall, but that gunite saved our bacon a lot of UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 41 times on how it supported the ground. And it kind of moved kind of like it was elastic; it moved together. Some places where you have a fault, you\u2019d see a shear, and then you might have a problem over here where, oh, several hundred ton come out of the roof or even the bottom heaves up four and five feet, but the bottom just comes right up against the back. It\u2019s hard to tell where and when it\u2019s going to happen. The geologists, they had it pretty well figured out after a while, about which kind of ground, which conditions would heave on you during zero time from [ 00: 25: 00] the ground motion from the device, because your ground\u2019s going to move around in there three and four feet. Sometimes they just [ claps hands together] close the tunnel up, just like you weren\u2019t even there, just a pile of rubble, and we\u2019d have to mine back through that, and that got to be a little bit dangerous sometimes. They\u2019d be careful, and it was slow. As far as our safety record out there, we had as good in the industry as there was. We got lucky, though. Got lucky. All you need is a little bit of luck, right? Lot of luck. Lot of luck. Yes. Because I\u2019ve even seen some close calls and I said, how in the heck did we ever get by it? But yes, if you could ever get out and go into that tunnel, see, this is your air and water line that goes up the tunnel. That\u2019s your ventilation. Big, huge 200- horsepower axle- veined fans, 100- horsepower axle- veined fans, four and five of them. I mean you could throw your hard hat underground and it\u2019d suck it down that pipe so fast. Working around it, I\u2019ve lost several hard hats. It\u2019ll suck it right off your head. Well, so shall we move to maybe what happens after the tunneling, the mining\u2014? Well, I think we\u2019ve pretty well got, you know, except going into the real intricacies of\u2014 we\u2019ve covered that pretty much. The final bit of mining and you get the\u2014 UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 42 Yes, the little assorted tasks that we would do, you know, required drilling and blasting. There was always something going on somewhere. And then a lot of core drilling went on, because from the bypass to the line- of- sight pipe, where there was cabling, electrical cables or coax cables or communication or scientific cables, data cables I guess you\u2019d call them. They would drill from the bypass a hole, oh, say, from four to six inches in diameter, some up to twelve, fourteen inches in diameter, through the rock to the line- of- sight pipe, or to that line- of- sight drift, and then they would bring cables out and go to different places in the pipe for their experiments. But they would do a lot of core drilling, and then that was done by the operating engineers. They call them diamond drills, and where the diamond part come, because they had a diamond bit on it, a diamond core bit, diamond- impregnated, so it would actually core over the rock and you could bring the rock out. In fact that\u2019s what these boxes are right here [ indicating items on shelf]. They\u2019re core sample boxes. Oh, so they just can just take them right out? Say they drill ten foot and they pull out the core barrel, they take and this box is sectioned off probably in a tray of one, two, three, four, four, I think it\u2019s about that big. I\u2019ve got a little bitty core but I don\u2019t have any big ones [ walking away]. That\u2019s a small core out of 15 shaft [ walking back and showing core]. That\u2019s granite. That actually came out of 15. Pile Driver. That seems perfectly symmetrical. It is. And that\u2019s hard. That\u2019s harder\u2014 that\u2019s what they call bird\u2019s eye blue granite and it is hard. You can take a regular rock drill that hits and turns and you have water on it, and there\u2019ll be fire spitting out of that hole that far [ indicating distance], with water in it. And so these were smaller, I don\u2019t even know what you call them but core- drilling\u2014 UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 43 Yes, most of them they did for recovery samples. This was done for\u2014 that was recovery, to see if the\u2014 when they stored the nuclear casks from power plants, they stored them at Climax. There was a test called Climax or a test bed, it was in 15 shaft, they stored these radioactive caskets in these ground holes for a year, I think, and they were about 1,300 degrees, and there\u2019s some exposure, but then they went back in later and core- drilled into the rock different depths to see if [ 00: 30: 00] the radiation and what effect the heat had upon the ground structure. Did it move it? Did it twist it? Because they were measuring everywhere on that tunnel all the time. And they put I think it was five of those caskets that were full of radioactive material, and they did it for a year, and then they pulled them out. They were from Turkey Point, Florida, out of their nuclear reactor in Turkey Point, Florida. We had five of them onsite for a long time. Where they ended up, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know where they took them to. Eventually maybe Yucca Mountain. Maybe. That\u2019s where it was supposed to go eventually because that\u2019s what Climax was, was the prototype for Yucca Mountain, in granite. Yucca Mountain\u2019s in the volcanic tuff. That come out of over by Pile Driver. Red Hot, Pile Driver, Hard Hat were three of the codenames and that was back in the fifties, \u2019 58, \u2019 59, \u2019 60, \u2019 61, \u2019 62, \u2019 63, maybe up to \u2019 64, they had three or four events in 15 shaft. Area 15. I bet I could find it in there. Pile Driver. [ Sound pages turning] In \u2019 59 [ 1966], I think. And so the line- of- sight pipe doesn\u2019t get put into the line- of- sight drift, tunnel. Is there a difference between a drift and a tunnel? Same. Drift. Tunnel. So are the crosscuts, bypass, and line- of- sight tunnel, are all those completed before you start putting the line- of- sight pipe in? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 44 Ninety- nine percent. There\u2019s always little tasks here and there, you know. Mighty Oak. Mint Leaf, that was a T Tunnel, 1970. That\u2019s where they had that Russian submarine missile. That was Mint Leaf at T Tunnel and that was May 5, 1970. Mission Ghost, \u2019 87. OK, I believe that was the first event at P Tunnel. Nineteen eight- seven. I was there. Hard Hat, 1962. That was the first one at\u2014 Red Hot. Maybe it might\u2019ve been Red Hot. That was before my time. I went out there in \u2019 67, so I don\u2019t\u2014 and a lot of them, all I ever heard was the stories and seen the aftereffects. Good. Now why don\u2019t we maybe transition to what comes next. What happens after, you said it takes about a year, after you start putting the line- of- sight pipe in. The mining takes anywhere from nine months to a year to complete the mining. OK. So how does your job transition once you start putting the line- of- sight pipe in? We\u2019re in support, and as soon as they put the pipe in, then our job as a mining cadre was to stem the tunnel. That means to grout or concrete the line- of- sight pipe into place and to construct and pour the containment plugs, and that was done with concrete. Are there types of concrete? They had a menu of concrete. I used to have a copy of it. There had to be over 150 different flavors of concrete. And each one of them had a name. Let\u2019s see, one of them I can remember was Midnight Zephyr Extra High Strength Groutcrete with ChemComp. And that\u2019s how they would write it, MZEHSG\u2014 Midnight Zephyr Extra High\u2014 and it seemed like every once in a while they\u2019d have an event, like Midnight Zephyr, and so they\u2019d name a concrete after it because Waterways Experiments [ U. S. Army Corps of Engineers] and USGS [ United States Geological Survey], they would [ 00: 35: 00] have quite a cadre of people working on concrete. Some of it they wanted\u2014 well, they had one concrete called Super Lean, and that was six yards of washed sand and one sack of UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 45 concrete. So when you poured it and it set up in the better part of a day, you could actually pull the form off and take and scrape it with your fingers, it was so soft. But it held. It\u2019s not like pouring wet sand and then when it dries out it\u2019s going to fall. This Super Lean was just\u2014 that\u2019s what it was. And it was used in certain places along the tunnel. Now in your containment plugs they had to have a different strength of concrete. Some of it in seven days it got up to 25,000 to 28,000 psi. Some high, hot stuff. That one I can remember, Midnight Zephyr Extra High Strength Groutcrete with ChemComp. ChemComp is a retardant to slow down the hardening process of it. Why would you want to slow down the hardening? So you would be able to work with it? So we can work it, yes, because some of it was real hot. And we had to pour it at a certain slump. They had all kinds of inspectors inspecting us pouring concrete. And they checked every load that come in, because it had to meet the containment committee\u2019s standards for hardness, the ability to seal the rock, and yet be like the rock. See, they didn\u2019t want it to get any harder than the rock, so they wanted to simulate the natural volcanic tuff. What would happen if it was harder than the rock? In some places, from the power, from the device explosion, would get between the concrete and the rock and form a pathway. So if it\u2019s the same, it doesn\u2019t. It won\u2019t get between the interface, I guess I want to call it, where the concrete comes up against the side of the tunnel, and it can go right down that tunnel and get into where it\u2019s not supposed to be. And there was certain places they wanted harder concrete, but most of the stemming was to stay as close as they could to the rock hardness, the same hardness that the volcanic natural was, that\u2019s what we had to pump concrete in. But I used to have a blueprint with all those types of concrete, and there was about a hundred different flavors of concrete. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 46 That\u2019s crazy. Yes, it was. And every time we\u2019d have a new shot, they\u2019d have a new flavor of concrete. So this isn\u2019t the type of concrete you can buy down at Home Depot or anything. This is like super- duper concrete? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is all kind of exotic concrete. They had fly ash in it. They had all kinds of stuff in it. So it wouldn\u2019t shrink. See, a lot of concrete will shrink, and once the water has dissipated, it\u2019ll shrink. Well, that would leave a gap between the rock line, or the interface, there\u2019d be a little bit of a gap. They couldn\u2019t have that. That would be bad. Yes. So we\u2019d even have to go in later and pressure- grout those places, set up big pumps with a real fluid type of concrete and pump it high, oh, 1,000 psi, 1,200 psi, 800. We weren\u2019t going to get too high because that would again fracture the rock, see. You get too much pressure. So they\u2019d make us go right up to a certain psi and then hold it right there. And sometimes we\u2019d have to hold on them for hours because they\u2019d bleed off and you got to pump them up again and they\u2019d bleed off and pump them up. So it\u2019s labor- intensive, and it goes on twenty- four hours a day. A lot of hours and hours and hours of pressure- grouting went in to seal the plugs, to seal the concrete and the rock interface. We couldn\u2019t have any voids. Couldn\u2019t. Couldn\u2019t afford a void. That would get us into more hot water than we could get out of, because we did it several times. We left some of the pipes empty and we didn\u2019t know it. On reentry, you know, when you\u2019re mining back through it and you see one of the pipes that ain\u2019t got\u2014 ohhh, boy! Here them inspectors are writing down\u2014 and then they have a meeting about it. Oh, yeah, that could really get us in somewhat of hot water with the containment. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 47 Yes, I bet. Well, and if on a good day, let\u2019s see, you said about six to eight feet of drilling a day, that\u2019s what, eighteen to twenty- four feet a day, somewhere in there? Maybe just say an average of twenty? [ 00: 40: 00] That would be a good figure. How quickly does the line- of- sight pipe go? And which way are you going? Do you go from\u2014? We work towards ground zero. Towards ground zero. OK. Except when you retreat, you know, once you put the device in, all you can do is go out. So we start at ground zero and pre- grout or pre- stem, they\u2019d call it pre- stemming. You pre- stem all the line- of- sight pipe into place. You do all the concreting you can ahead of time. That\u2019s so when they bring the device in, the only thing you\u2019ve got to do is plug up your pathway, the bypass drift and some of the crosscuts. Most of the crosscuts are already pre- stemmed up for, let\u2019s see, the one into the FAC, we usually have to pour usually simultaneously while we\u2019re readying a pour in the bypass after they\u2019ve inserted the device. We\u2019ll make a pour over here and then one over here and one there and one back here and then it all comes together, but we have to stagger our pours. What I mean by stagger them, you\u2019ve got a pour here so it can be hardened and so they can be getting ready for another pour behind it, because the pours were about a hundred foot long, and you went back in there, say, a thousand feet, so we had ten pours, roughly. It varied from, I\u2019d have to get a map and look at the bulkheads on there, the stemming bulkhead, but they\u2019re roughly about a hundred feet. Some of them, the anchor plugs, which would be the last plug in the stemming, we called that anchor plug, that\u2019s the one that\u2019s got to hold. Some of them up in there can fail a little bit, but that one better not fail or the tunnel\u2019s in trouble. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 48 I\u2019m sorry if I missed the answer, but like when you start the line- of- sight pipe and you\u2019re going towards the test bed, the device, the device is not in yet. No. How quickly are you moving on that? How quickly does that go? OK, once they start fielding your line- of- sight pipe, it would take the fitters and the miners about, oh, I\u2019d say anywhere from seven to nine months to install the pipe, because they come in in about fifty- foot sections, thirty- foot sections, so they had to be welded. You know, a twelve- foot weld all the way around is a lot of welding. And for the pipe fitters to get in there. They\u2019d weld twenty- four hours a day. But it\u2019d take to install, to line, because they had to line that pipe, you know, they shined a laser beam right down the center and they had crosshairs. They\u2019d hang a crosshair on the pipe and they\u2019d have to be right on, dead right, zero tolerance, putting that laser beam down that pipe. And that\u2019s how they could get that big pipe centered. And then we\u2019d concrete around it so it wouldn\u2019t move. Because they had to pump a vacuum on it later. And so you did the two things relatively simultaneously? You would concrete and go back with the\u2014 no, that can\u2019t be right. No, we\u2019d install the pipe\u2014 And then you\u2019d concrete. Then we\u2019d weld it, and once they\u2014 So you\u2019d install the whole pipe, then you\u2019d weld. OK. And then they\u2019d pump a vacuum on it to make sure there were no pinholes and leaks in the pipe. And then they would say, all right, the pipe is sealed. Then we would go back in and build bulkheads about every hundred feet, and then we\u2019d pump up a hundred foot and that\u2019d hold that, and then retreat out and pump another hundred foot and another hundred foot until you get to the end of stemming and the line- of- sight pipe is there. It\u2019s encapsulated in concrete, different UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 49 flavors and hardnesses of concrete, some that it\u2019s soft for a reason. And in fact there\u2019s even one section in one of the FAS gate or the MAC where they just blow sand in, just regular desert fines, because they wanted that little twenty- foot area for this high- det explosion to collapse that pipe. And then they wanted the gases to start to go out into the rubble zone, but then not to go beyond that. You can get out this far, but don\u2019t go beyond that. And they got to where they could target. It\u2019s incredible, isn\u2019t it? In fact, one of the things that used to get me about it, in the craters down in where you seen the pictures of the bomb craters, they\u2019d come up and they\u2019d take the laborers out there and they\u2019d [ 00: 45: 00] build a fence around the area that was going to crater, and when that thing subsided, caved in on itself after zero time, oh, sometimes two or three hours, the whole thing would just cave in on itself. You could go right up to within about three or four feet of that fence and the rest of it was just a big crater. And how in the world do they know it\u2019s going to crater out this far? They\u2019re good. Because it know it wasn\u2019t the laborers that did that, but so many feet from ground zero they had to have a fence for later, and that\u2019s exactly\u2014 let\u2019s see if I have one here. This shows you a picture of some of the [ sound of pages turning] at Baneberry. Like if this is the main tunnel, and then this is the line- of- sight tunnel, right, if that\u2019s the main tunnel, this one, and that\u2019s the line- of- sight tunnel [ indicating on diagram], do you concrete all the way back to here? End of stemming. End of stemming can vary. OK, so that\u2019s like the map you showed me somewhere. OK. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 50 Yes, and they all vary different, according to what the size of the yield they anticipate to be, how much do we need, 800 feet this way, 1,000. See, you got 800 feet of overburden above you, you need that much here, and they\u2019d usually go about 10 percent over. That was a rule of thumb that I figured, or at least we\u2019re going to give you another hundred feet to play with, at least a hundred foot on what they call the anchor plug or the end of stemming. Same thing. And that end of stemming, that\u2019s where it really has to\u2014 That\u2019s got to stop anything that might get away, other than if it comes down the line- of- sight pipe, and if it comes down the pipe and the pipe ruptures, there ain\u2019t much you can do about it. See here [ sound of pages turning]. See all these craters? Those are old bomb craters. It looks like the moon. It does look like the moon. Yes. And they\u2019d have a fence all the way around that thing. [ 00: 47: 22] End Track 2, Disc 2. [ 00: 00: 00] Begin Track 2, Disc 3. All right, so we have the line- of- sight pipe in. Let me see if I get the terminology right. You\u2019ve concreted back to stemming? End of stemming. To end of stemming. I was close. End of stemming or anchor plug, either one. Is the bypass tunnel still\u2014? Open. Open. So that\u2019s the last thing you do, because you need some access to get\u2014 UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 51 You have to have access to insert the device and get your scientific people back in, and then as they come out, then they have to arm certain cables, make certain splices, or not splices probably at that time but they have to arm the FAC, MAC, GSAC, TAPS, they have to arm them. OK, they\u2019re already armed. You have to go into a firing box and put that in readiness, and then that firing box would be concreted in, but they have to pull the shunts out and all the safety devices, protective devices, and then get it ready to go, and then we retreat out of the bypass. But there\u2019s probably four places along there we\u2019ve got to stop and let the scientists make their adjustments on the closures, because that\u2019s all done from the bypass side, or close to it, where we can get a firing box in there. And right now, at this stage of the process, you can still go into the line- of- sight tunnel, right? Or pipe, excuse me. And go almost all the way back, right? Well, you can go back till it gets too small to crawl. But yeah, you can go back, like I said, that far. Do people ever need to do that, to tinker with the experiments or anything? Yes, Yes, Yes, because there are gauges back in there, there are gauges and experiments that they have to get back in to be at, yeah. So actually they have big doors. I saw one on this one here. See, these are entrance doors. See that one? You can imagine one, oh, they looked more or less like, if you had your big line- of- sight pipe, they have just a big hatch that you would be able to seal it because they had big wing nuts, much like a hatch on a ship, a bulkhead hatch, exactly the same thing. So they could put a vacuum on that pipe, because it had to seal, because they had to put a vacuum on the inside of that pipe before zero time, down to I don\u2019t know how many microns. It got down to an almost perfect vacuum. Real close. Was that one of the reasons why they put the vacuum on it, is to make sure there was no\u2014? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 52 Nothing. Yes. So it\u2019s not so much to simulate outer space as it is to make sure there\u2019s no\u2014 or it\u2019s both, I guess, but to make sure there\u2019s no punctures or\u2014 Because a lot of the testing was done for outer space, so they had to simulate that as close as they could. OK. And is there a sense of, I would imagine that some tests needed to be closer to\u2014 at that point, does proximity matter, you know, the experiments in the line- of- sight pipe? As long as the shine can hit them, because they all have to have a little real estate. In that one picture you\u2019ve seen that they\u2019re this was always a good\u2014 How did the welds hold? Good. They got some of the best welders in the country, and they did it all with wire feed, heliarc. See all these little experiment stations? Anything back here or up ahead of it can\u2019t interfere with this shine. It has its own little\u2014 all the way to ground zero. Each one of these, even the stub pipes, and they\u2019re along the outside of the pipe. But each one of these things was placed in a strategic position to where when this shine comes down the pipe, you don\u2019t get a shadow from one interfering with the other. In fact, see, you couldn\u2019t put one right behind here. They all had to have\u2014 They each had to get their own part of the light, the shine, the light. Right. And that\u2019s why they got into the twelve- foot pipe, see, they could have more area down there, where if they put them all up front, they wouldn\u2019t. So the bigger the pipe, usually the more [ 00: 05: 00] experiments they had. And they usually had two test chambers. This is a major test chamber and then they\u2019d have one\u2014 in fact, the door to that test chamber is right in front of this. Yes. I\u2019ve probably been in this pipe right here. I bet I have [ p. 24]. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 53 So where are we in the process? If the line- of- sight pipe is done, if the concrete has been poured to end of stemming, how many months out are we now? How close are we to the event and how far away from here? We\u2019re within three to four months of execution. Whatever it takes for the electrical people, the techs to get all their stuff ready, their experiments all ready and in and tested, so they\u2019ll go through several dry runs. Probably every day they\u2019ll have three or four dry runs. And the dry runs start occurring at that point where you have\u2014? Once all the fielding is done, what I mean by fielding, all the experiments are in, and then they\u2019ve pumped a vacuum on the pipe, and then they\u2019ll have a dry run. Everything\u2019s working good, everything looks good. Then once they\u2019ve determined that the experiments and the experimenters are done, all the recording stations are set to go, the computers, in big, huge alcoves or drifts, sometimes they call it a dance hall, too. It was about, oh, thirty foot wide, probably two hundred foot long, and it\u2019d be plumb full of little trailers, a trailer much like a little square house trailer, only about, oh, about twenty foot long, eight- by- eight- by- twenty, fifteen, and inside these was all their recording stations and computers. Mostly recording stations. And then all the cables were run to them. And then there was a cable run from them on to the surface, into the mesa, because they had trailers sitting up there that would record, too, outside, up on the mesa, because they had a drill hole through from the surface down with cabling going up that they could connect to and put more recording trailers on the surface. But that was usually outside of the crater area. But one time they didn\u2019t. RADSAFE went up there and they were in one of the trailers checking it out when it started to crater. Killed one of them. There were about four people went down in it. I think one was killed. One broke his leg. That was at T Tunnel, too, but I don\u2019t know UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 54 if it was Mighty Oak or it was the one before Mighty Oak. But yeah, the kid that got hurt, I knew him in Pahrump. He died. He was a RADSAFE. And they have to go back. That\u2019s when they really come into focus is when on reentry, because of the possibility of radiation leaks, gas leaks and stuff. And there was always some, but most of it was minute. It\u2019ll tell you in this book here if there was any [ DOE/ NV\u2014 209- Rev 15 December 2000]. OK. And so if the dry runs have gone off without a hitch\u2014 Then they give us the go- ahead and they order the device and bring it up on the job, usually about, oh, it shows up about seven in the morning, and we take it underground and they\u2019re ready to start pumping concrete or stemming, they give us the OK to start stemming. Is there a tension when the device shows up? Yes. I mean are the same people allowed to show up at work, or is it\u2014? Usually no, except the need to know and the need to be there, you\u2019re escorted in and out. They got a visual authority, a VO. I don\u2019t know what that acronym means. VO is visual authorization. OK. So you had a badge. You wore your badge. And then they\u2019d log you in and log you out. So you had to be on a list of some kind to get in there. And the number of cadre was at a minimum. Always at the bare minimum. We had people standing by down twenty miles away or ten miles away, or in a bus sitting at the bottom of the hill somewhere, all your craftsmen, but they were ready to go pumping concrete. As soon as we got ground zero buttoned up, then they would turn it over to us. [ 00: 10: 00] When the device came, how much time between that morning, that seven a. m. in the morning when the device shows up to where the event\u2019s actually going to take place? Are we weeks away? Are we months away? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 55 It took us somewhere on the average of seven days to button the tunnel up. We retreated and pumped all that concrete in about seven days. Then your gas- sealed containment plugs had to have a cure of about three days to reach the hardness to contain any possible leaks. It had to get somewhere around the 20,000 psi range, the hardness of the concrete. If the device got there at seven, at what point would they leave and the device already, you know, how long would it take for them to show up, install the device, and then have you have your crew come back and be able to start working? They call it emplacement. Three or four hours. Short time. It doesn\u2019t take them long to assemble it, but there\u2019d have to be a protocol, usually a DNA or a Navy or an Army, DoD personnel has to be there. Usually it\u2019s the engineer in charge. You know, I knew several. On this one here, Ricky Richards, Lieutenant Richards, he was the [ DNA test] engineer that I answered to, the first line of engineer. He kind of was the captain of the ship, well, in the engineering part. I would\u2019ve been the captain of the ship and I had a boss, a project manager, which oversaw all of the\u2014 each one of the crafts usually had a superintendent. I was over the carpenters, the miners, the laborers, some electricians, and some pipe fitters. The pipe fitters had a superintendent and an engineer, and the electricians had a superintendent and an engineer, usually. OK. And what was that called? Was it past time? Late time. Late time. And so we\u2019re here and then if the device shows up on a Monday, how long does it usually take before the event actually happens? I\u2019m just wondering. Seven to ten days. It took us about seven days to retreat, pump all the concrete, pull and close the doors. Only had one big door to close. I would say eight, nine days. About seven days to what they call button up. Final button- up would be closing all the little hatches. You had big doors that UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 56 closed the tunnel, but you had little hatches that people could crawl in and out of to get up to the end of stemming, see, in case they had to go back in and go in the line- of- sight pipe; they could actually pull the vacuum off, open up the pipe\u2014 that was costly and it usually cost them time when they did it, a day or two\u2014 and they could go in and make an adjustment and go out and then pump the pipe back down, and that usually took about, oh, twelve to fourteen hours to pump this pipe down to vacuum. Sometimes longer, according to how big the pipe was, again. Because they had big roughing pumps and then they had finishing pumps that\u2019d really get her down to however many microns they wanted to. And then once the final button- up was made, then we\u2019d retreat to control point, which was CP, into the \u201c war room,\u201d I think they called it. What was the last actual thing you did in the tunnel before you left and went to control point? Closed the hatch on the gas- sealed door, the last closure in the tunnel. What\u2019s the line- of- sight pipe doing right now? Sitting there with a vacuum on it. But I mean is it open at the other end? No, no, no, they\u2019ve got a big dome on the end of it. It\u2019s all closed. So you close that down, too. Yes, it\u2019s got a vacuum on it. See, there would be a big dome fit on the [ 00: 15: 00] end of this. Say this was the end of the pipe [ p. 24], there\u2019d be a big dome fit on there, and then a bunch of stub pipes, them little pipes would be run off of it to various experiment stations. Now at this point, is all of your attention as the mining superintendent devoted to this particular test? I mean has the next thing you\u2019re going to do come across your radar screen yet? No, we\u2019re focused on execution and reentry. OK. Are you out there\u2014? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 57 Here\u2019s your war room [ p. 27]. This is where they actually say test control center, and I would get to be back up here, more or less in just readiness. I didn\u2019t have no function other than to watch it go on. Here\u2019s your test controller. That\u2019s Larry Ashbaugh or Joe LaComb there. That looks like NORAD a little bit, or NASA [ National Aeronautics and Space Administration]. In a way, because it\u2019s all weather stations. They can tell weather, they can tell everything, they can tell you what the line- of- sight pipe is, what the temperature is at ground zero, and they have to keep ground zero at a certain temperature, so there has to be refrigeration units run right up until zero time, then they shut all power off. They can do that remote, shut all power off, and put a key in, turn it, which they\u2019ve already done that in the red shack, and then the countdown is done automatic. What\u2019s the feeling like, being in that room? Well, it just like, I think, much like a space shuttle or anything like that. Everybody\u2019s been working for sometimes three, four weeks, seven days a week. We don\u2019t shut down, you know, and it gets to where there ain\u2019t much left of you. Well, I mean a year and a half total, right, in that neighborhood, and it all boils down to this single moment? And then they can tell in a few minutes, because there\u2019ll be different places along the tunnel where they can tell if there was a radiation leak. And so is it like a mechanized countdown, you know, ten, nine, eight\u2014? Yes. Especially the last thirty seconds, OK, how was it? Let\u2019s see if I can remember how it was. It\u2019ll be, OK, \u201c time minus three minutes, T Tunnel, Distant Zenith,\u201d and then over the loudspeaker in another minute, \u201c minus two minutes, zero time, Distant Zenith,\u201d and then during UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 58 the real thing it gets down to the last\u2014 and even during the dry runs, it gets down to the last fifteen, twenty seconds, they count it down, ten, nine, eight, seven, zero time, T Tunnel, P03. I mean is it anticlimactic? Because I mean with the space shuttle, you actually get to see the space shuttle going up or\u2014 You don\u2019t see anything. If you\u2019re outside, you might get to see some dust come off the mesa. OK. Because you can\u2019t hear anything, right? No, nothing. So the first time must\u2019ve been kind of almost a letdown, somehow. Yes. Here\u2019s your radiation monitors [ p. 67], see, they\u2019re all up and down the tunnel, each one of them black spots, and this is ground zero. Here\u2019s end of stemming, right there. So if there\u2019s any leaks, all over this tunnel and clear outside the portal, out over the portal, because see our offices are over here. This is the portal. And all these are RAMS [ radiation area monitoring systems]. Mission Cyber, December 2, \u2019 88. So you know pretty much instantaneously whether or not everything is OK. The temperature, everything, yeah, they can tell within, oh, twenty seconds whether they\u2019re going to have failure. And failure means that somehow radiation gas got out from something. And they can pretty well tell where it came from. And you as a mining superintendent in the war room after twenty- one seconds after, what are you thinking now? What do you do? We get to go home. OK, so you go. And then what\u2019s the turnaround time between detonation and you going back? I was on several of them in the beginning, but once the execution goes over, the authorities hand it over to DNA, to Joe LaComb and that type, the top dogs, they call the shots from then on. So UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 59 we would have a standby group of reentry people, in case they have to go back in or go back in [ 00: 20: 00] and establish a fresh- air station at the portal. Right outside here, over here there\u2019s a big building, and that\u2019s where they establish a, OK, everything, the portal\u2019s clear, there\u2019s no radiation escape, there\u2019s no contamination, we\ufffd\ufffdre OK to go to the portal. But we can\u2019t go underground yet, but we can go to the portal. So you go up there and you assemble your reentry teams. You usually have three of them. You have a reentry team, a rescue team, and a standby team. And there are about six, seven men on each one of them. Then they can tell at all times by their RAMS or their monitors if there is any gas buildup or pressure buildup or if there\u2019s a problem, they can tell. But they physically go in there and check every foot of it and assess what they call scientific assessment. They look at the tunnel and they look at the rail and they make sure this is OK and it\u2019s all under microphone in a self- contained\u2014 like they went after them miners in Virginia, same thing. And you\u2019re out there for all this. No? Yes? OK. Yes. Usually we get to go home and shower and change clothes and get back up here by eight o\u2019clock in the morning. Say this is two o\u2019clock in the afternoon. They\u2019ll take, and I won\u2019t have any part of that, establishing a safe area at the portal. Once that\u2019s done, then we show up, usually the next morning around nine, ten o\u2019clock. Reporting time is eight. We\u2019d go up and assemble our rescue teams, and everything\u2019s pre- staged there, and then the test controller will tell us, All right, let\u2019s advance to the gas- sealed door. So we\u2019ll take a train and go as far as the first gas- sealed door is. Then they\u2019ll have a group of people under that little hatch I\u2019m talking about. And then we\u2019ll open that up. And then they\u2019ll go on through and they\u2019ll go to the next plug. They\u2019ll open up another hatch in a little turn tube and crawl through it and go up to the end of stemming on both the bypass and the LOS drift, and they\u2019re going to check for radiation, any UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 60 leaks, any gas leaks, any explosive mixtures. And once that\u2019s assessed that there\u2019s no problem, then we\u2019ll turn the ventilation on, the big ventilation outside, and that\u2019ll start ventilating the tunnel. And then usually that night we have a swing shift come on and we\u2019ve got authorization to open the big gas- sealed door. So the iron workers will go in there and open that huge door, probably weighs thirty tons, forty tons, and pull it around, and lay rail back so we can get our engines in it. And then the next day, we\u2019ll go up to the next plug, which is the overburden plug or the gas- sealed plug, not the door, the plug, and they\u2019ll go through there. A lot of the scientists go back in. If they have to recover film right away, they\u2019ll take a scientific assessment team and it\u2019ll last usually two or three hours. They won\u2019t be underground over an hour and a half. And they\u2019ll go in and get their film or something and pull it out. And then they\u2019ll let us ventilate the tunnel, continue to ventilate and continue to hook up our ventilation, and then we\u2019ll start mining back through the gas- sealed plug, which is usually drilling and blasting. Sometimes they\u2019ll let us go through these trainways with an Alpine \u2122 miner. In the early times that we had to do it, the drill and blast, but then once the Alpine \u2122 come in, then we go right down through the middle of this plug and mine out the center of it. That way, we can get our trains back in and all of our personnel. Because on a busy day you would have 200 people underground, 250, on a shift, not usually a back shift so much but on day shift you would have anywhere from the bare minimum you\u2019re going to have is about fifty or sixty, and then however many watchers and tourists that you got, people with nothing else to do that want to come watch. As far as the line- of- sight pipe, are you taking that whole thing out, or just the experiments out? Both. Sometimes they reclaimed the line- of- sight pipe up to the end of stemming, took it out, sent it to Spokane or sometimes they\u2019d do it onsite, sandblast it and clean it up and if there was [ 00: 25: 00] any radiation, you know, they\u2019ll decontaminate it, and then they\u2019ll reuse that, UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 61 especially your test chambers, because they were a lot of labor in there. The regular bare line- of- sight pipe, they can probably make that easier and cheaper than redo it. But a lot of your TAPS, they would reuse the TAPS, the tunnel and pipe seal, and that probably weighed sixty tons, eighty tons, sometimes a hundred tons, according to how big it was. Huge. Is there any reason for you guys to go back through the bypass tunnel? We do go down the bypass as far as the end of stemming, and they\u2019ll set up a diamond drill and tag ground zero. I mean a core drill, like I\u2019m saying, they\u2019ll actually core into, under special conditions, blowout preventers, you know, and full safety gear, they\u2019ll tag ground zero. I mean tag the melt or the molten rock or the area where ground zero once was. Is there any ground zero anymore? Well, it\u2019s where imaginary was. It\u2019s nothing but a big cavity, or that\u2019s usually cave\u2014 Yeah, I was going to say, is there a cavity anymore or has it been caved in? Just a chimney, yeah. In the early times, some of the events they had, the big megatons on the mesa, did leave a cavity. Benham [ 12/ 19/ 1968, U20i, 1.15 Mt] or Boxcar [ 4/ 26/ 1968, U20c, 1.3 Mt], I can\u2019t remember which one. Boxcar was the biggest, or Benham? They were the biggest megatons done on the test site. I think we only did two or three megatons. And the scientists said that there was a cavity there that you could put Boulder Dam in. That\u2019s 7,000 feet. Big as Boulder Dam. A cavity of 7,000 feet, as big as Boulder Dam? Yes. And then it would cave in, every once in a while you\u2019d hear\u2014 you\u2019d be down\u2014 I was underground at 19G and you could feel that. It wouldn\u2019t be a rocking, swaying motion. You\u2019d feel the energy, I guess, through the tunnel wall because Benham was only about five miles UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 62 away, but there\u2019d be huge cave- ins inside that cavity for a long time, for two or three months. Every once in a while, we\u2019d feel that cave- in. You can\u2019t hear\u2014 From five miles away, you would feel it? Yes. Underground. Yes. Because it had to be huge. I mean you got to have boulders flying around there, or falling. Not flying but falling. You know, as big as Boulder Dam, that\u2019s huge. And then, you know, it stayed a cavity, an open cavity, pretty much for quite a while, three or four months. And then every once in a while we\u2014 because we couldn\u2019t figure out what it was. So finally one of the bosses, they said, Hey, we\u2019re going to shut this thing down, and finally got some of the scientists and they started coordinating their geophones with the time it would happen and said, well, yeah, that\u2019s all that is, is whatever the codename was, Benham or Boxcar. But it was in the megaton range. A million tons of TNT. Most of them we did in the tunnels were kilotons. Fifteen, twenty kilotons. We have three- and- a- half minutes. We can always put another CD in, but is there anything you feel like I should know about the post- detonation? It\u2019s still the same mining for us except we went much slower and you usually had the scientists right there. When you got close to one of their experiments, oh, they\u2019d be right there, well, we got to mine just a little slow and do a lot of it by hand with spaders and chippers until they got one of their gauges out and they\u2019d let us go again. But we\u2019d reenter down and they inspected every foot of it. How long between the time you actually start the reentry process and the time where it\u2019s done, complete, you\u2019re ready to move on to the next task? Three or four months. That long? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 63 Yes. By the time you get all the mining done, back, because we had to mine back in usually to the GSAC and MAC to check them out, and they\u2019d pull them out and reuse them. So we went back within, oh, 300 feet, 400 feet of ground zero, with our mining. Usually down the same old drift. We just mined the old concrete out. Because they wanted to see how, again, if we did a good job of filling the tunnel. Because one time we didn\u2019t. It was at P Tunnel. I got my ___ chewed on a little bit. They said, hey! Oh, and I saw it. I says, oh, shit. Because I\u2019d seen it first. I [ 00: 30: 00] said, oh, my God. What they call a top- off hole. Say this was the tunnel here [ drawing] and every so often we\u2019d have to drill a hole up in here, up in the back or the roof, oh, that big around [ indicating size] and then stick a four- inch pipe in there. And then we\u2019d pump on that last. That was the bleed to let the air off. And when this tunnel got plumb full of concrete, it would force it up in here and out this little pipe, because there would be a pipe in there, and then it\u2019d be run clear out to the bulkhead, see. So this is a top- off number 2. Top- off number 2. When that got full of concrete, you knew that the drift was full of concrete. But not always. It didn\u2019t always run that way. See, there would be voids in it, and just sometimes the concrete would be up in there but yet this little bit would be void, see. You couldn\u2019t have that. No voids whatsoever. Because, see, once it\u2014 exponential numbers that went on, once that gas got into this, see, it could create more and more and more. Then it could get away from you. So we had to make sure everything was gas- sealed tight. Labor intensive. Hours and hours. Yes, it sounds like it. Well, we literally have fifty seconds left. Sum up a test in fifty seconds. Yes, that\u2019s it, sum up a test. Get ready for the next one. That\u2019s what we did. Yeah. Would you get any time off or would it be basically done with this one, all right\u2014? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 64 Some. Well, yeah, the heat would be off once the reentry was established and we got back to the everyday way of doing business, mining the bypass and stuff like that, yeah, we\u2019d get time off. It wasn\u2019t bad. But you didn\u2019t ask for none of that until after zero time. We\u2019re at T- minus- 10, so [ laughing]. OK. All right, that\u2019s good. Thanks, John.

The goal is to create an archive which adds relevant material to the existing historical record. Oral history recordings and transcripts are primary source material and do not represent the final, verified, or complete narrative of the events under discussion. Rather, oral history is a spoken remembrance or dialogue, reflecting the interviewee\u2019s memories, points of view and personal opinions about events in response to the interviewer\u2019s specific questions. Oral history interviews document each interviewee\u2019s personal engagement with the history in question.

Campbell January 31, 2006 in Las Vegas, NV Conducted by Charlie Deitrich [ 00: 00: 00] Begin Track 2, Disc 1. Charlie Deitrich: I just wanted first of all to say thanks, and you\u2019re going to run us basically through the beginning to the end of an event, the Distant Zenith event [ 0919/ 1991]. John Campbell: [ A] nuclear test, the nuclear weapons test, and it was for Defense Nuclear Agency [ DNA] which was a DoD, Department of Defense [ test], and that\u2019s where our funding came through. And I worked for Reynolds Electric and Engineering [ REECo] and their parent company was EG it\u2019s when\u2014 The second they push the red button. Oh, that is zero time? That\u2019s zero. OK. And then there\u2019s some time between zero time and when you collect all the data and whatnot. We call it X- minus- eighteen months, just like you were counting down, that\u2019s the way they do it. When it gets down to minus- ten minutes and then they get right down and then they count down the last twenty seconds, fifteen, ten, nine, eight, and all of what\u2019s done is then automatic. The control point must be somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty, twenty- five miles from P Tunnel, and it\u2019s done remotely from about twenty miles away. But there\u2019s cameras everywhere. They\u2019ve got underground\u2014 they even have cameras right on the device, but there are very few people see that. You ever see it? One time. Really. Yes. I got to see two devices while the scientists were hooking them up, doing the wiring and the measuring and whatever they do, their part. They were, what do they call that, device engineers. They would bring it in. But once it went underground through the portal, the responsibility of the men\u2019s safety was my responsibility because I was the mining superintendent, so I would usually be on the team that would walk the flatcar in, pushed by a motor, with the pig on it, and a pig is a UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 7 lead- shielded containment vessel for transportation of the nuclear device. And then they\u2019d take it up to ground zero and there\u2019d be probably a party of about, including security, there\u2019d be, oh, ten, twelve of us that would escort this thing to ground zero, and then they\u2019d have your industrial hygiene and RADSAFE, the radiation technicians, they would check for leaks and this and do their safety checks, and then take the device out of the pig, place it into A Box. And when they took it out of the pig and placed it in the A Box is when I was standing in a position that I could see what went on. And I waited for, what was it, [ 00: 15: 00] twenty- five years to see that. It was kind of disappointing a little bit because, is that all it is? Well, yeah, a twenty- five- year buildup, it\u2019s hard to imagine it not being disappointing. Because very few people got to see it. Very few people got to see it. Well, I knew that some of the scientists and the DoD people, your test engineers, because DNA, or Defense Nuclear Agency, was our main customer. It\u2019s got a new name now. They\u2019ve renamed that. Something to do with weapons. I\u2019ve heard it a couple of times [ Defense Threat Reduction Agency ( DTRA)]. So to go back to kind of march through our chronology here, when you say \u201c field experiments,\u201d that means actually putting the experiments into the field? Yes. You weren\u2019t a part of the process of choosing the experiments. You were the people that somebody said, \u201c we want to do this,\u201d and you make it happen. And we did it. The scientists would come to us with the impossible. They\u2019d want to put a ten- foot plug in a nine- foot hole. Really! And we did it. This is again at T Tunnel, they brought in a hunk of granite, probably weighed ten, twenty ton. Huge. And it was the exact same size as our drift that we drove. And there was a place where they had drilled them holes. And this was a huge piece of granite, you know, three times the size of a car, and they had strategically placed UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 8 holes in this and holes all the way through, part of it was polished to high polish on it, it was shaped really weird, and that was put in ground zero and then all the experiment line- of- sight pipes were hooked up. And what that was for, I never did ever find out what it was for, but that\u2019s what they would do, the scientists. Sometimes we weren\u2019t on the same page; they were in their own little world. But they knew that we would get it done for them. Somehow, someway, we got that thing in that. It took us four or five days, but we got it back in that and placed into that tunnel. And correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but it seems like your job was to get on their page, or to make their page\u2014 Fit ours. Yes. They already had theirs. Theirs was set in concrete or, you know, it was written in\u2014 so we had to figure out a way to accommodate that. I don\u2019t know if we mentioned this yet, but what year was [ Distant] Zenith? Do you remember? I can find out. Let\u2019s see if I can see the\u2014 Distant Zenith. Let\u2019s see if I can find it. [ Sound of pages turning] If you\u2019re looking for that, I guess\u2014 I didn\u2019t want to break you from your chronology. Oh, that\u2019s all right. Distant Zenith, September 19, \u2019 91. And so the eighteen- month thing, you found out, what, early summer, late spring of\u2014 We probably knew they were going to do at least three events at P Tunnel when they first started it. We knew that we had at least three test beds to do, so it was, oh, we knew in plenty of time to get ready for the Distant Zenith, because it wasn\u2019t the first one that we did. I think Disko Elm was one of the first we did at P Tunnel. Again, I\u2019d have to go back and make sure because there were about five events that we did at P Tunnel. At N Tunnel there\u2019s must\u2019ve been\u2014 because that went on for forty years. I mean it, oh, no, since 1958. They worked underground at N Tunnel UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 9 [ 00: 20: 00] forever. And I was one of the last human beings out of the old part of the tunnel. Now it\u2019s full of water. I was still employed there when they\u2014 we called it \u201c button it up.\u201d They removed as much hazardous material as they could from the tunnel and all them miles and miles and miles, literally miles of drift that was in that mountain, they went out with big containment plugs, closed the doors, and turned the pumps off and virtually turned all of the power off underground. So you literally were one of the guys that turned out the lights as you left. I was the one that called the department office and got permission to call Dispatch and turn the power off at N Tunnel. It\u2019s kind of like putting an old friend to sleep, because I\u2019d worked there fifteen years and had supported my family fifteen years with that tunnel. So I got to be there at the last, and there was no big fanfare, nothing. I just walked over to the telephone and called Chris Evans, the dispatcher in charge of Electrical, and I said, Shut her down. And so they got the lineman out and shut all the power to the transformers off, and she went to sleep. Started filling full of water. And that was ten years ago, so there\u2019s a lot of water in that mountain right today. In fact. OK, so where were we in our\u2014? Well, I\u2019ll just read some of the statistics from this Distant Zenith, and the amount of tunneling that was done, there was about 4,450 foot of tunnel. It was began October \u2019 89 and completed June \u2019 90, the mining was completed. [ Reading from Distant Zenith statistic sheet]. [ 00: 22: 02] End Track 2, Disc 1. [ 00: 00: 00] Begin Track 3, Disc 1. And we\u2019re back. OK, where\u2019d we leave off at? Tunneling? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 10 Yes. [ Reading from Distant Zenith statistic sheet]. There was about 4,450 foot of tunnel. We began mining in October of \u2019 89 and completed mining in June 1990. And the overburden or the ground cover over ground zero was 880 feet. Ground zero, distance from portal, 4,900 feet. Amount of earth removed, 29,496 cubic yards. Line- of- sight pipe, 800 foot long, diameter from six inches to twelve foot. The event bag, which was a nylon type of material that they filled full of exotic gases, it was 550 foot long. What\u2019s that for, again? They filled it full of several exotic gases. For what, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know exactly what they were after by filling it full of gas. And the diameter was fifteen- and- a- half foot to twenty foot. Volume, 138,300 cubic feet. And they filled this full of gas and I\u2019m not sure what it was for, but it more or less virtually was just a big balloon inside of the tunnel, and it was 550 foot long and they filled it full of these gases. They had bottles and bottles and bottles of different types of gases, and a little bit of this and a little bit of that, and then that was filled up and kept full until zero time. I guess it\u2019s the X- rays or something. I don\u2019t know. Or the EMP, the electromagnetic pulse that comes from off the device when it\u2019s detonated. I never did find out why they did that. And some things I knew better than to ask too much about. And there was 400 miles of cabling, from fiber optic to coax cables, and there was 1,200 channels. The budget was forty- seven million [ dollars]. And that\u2019s just the budget for this. The overall budget I know was bigger than that. The picture was a lot bigger than just here. But the forty- seven million is just the budget for the Distant Zenith test? Project. Yes. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 11 Well, that\u2019s, you know, fifty million is fifty million. And adjusted for inflation nowadays, I mean, you know. How much? What is it? I don\u2019t know, maybe sixty, seventy million now. I bet. Yes, seventy. And we couldn\u2019t afford to do business the way we did today because of safety and the rules on radiation exposure, that has changed tremendously. In fact, we couldn\u2019t do it. The way we used to do it, we couldn\u2019t do it. They don\u2019t have enough money to get it done. Is that good or bad? I\u2019m going to say it\u2019s a little bit of both. It\u2019s bad in one sense because you lose out on the knowledge, but then if they\u2019re tasked to do it a better\u2014 get the same results a better, cheaper, safer way\u2014 and that was one of the things that we were challenged again and again and again was we got to do it cheaper, we\u2019ve got to do it safer\u2014 and usually it was somebody paid for it in blood. It was usually something happened that we had to. We had to clean up our act. Or there would be a leak or something would happen. And that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds how they learned, by doing, because they never knew for sure what was going to happen. In the early days, they didn\u2019t know how big the device was going to be. They just kind of guessed at it, see. Some of them went over yield; some went under yield. And there\u2019s no way they could figure out\u2014 in fact I had one scientist tell me that the device, it has a mind of its own. When it\u2019s first detonated, it goes out, trying to escape, you know, the path of least resistance, and then it goes back in again and comes out again with more power. If you can hold it that time, you got it. It\u2019ll contain itself then. [ 00: 05: 00] OK, so we\u2019re still fairly early in the process, right? Is there anything you want to say about the process of fielding the experiments? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 12 Well, the mining entailed, too, before we could ever field the experiments, the mining had to be completed and there were a lot of plugs, closures, places for closures that. If we had a picture, you could see it better, but for me to explain, in this series of drifts that we\u2019d mined, there had to be places for closures, which would seal the radiation, the debris, everything off from going down the line- of- sight pipe. It had to be done in nanoseconds. And during the mining process, we had to superharden the ground, and that was done with ground support rock bolts that were fully epoxied up to twenty foot long\u2014 twenty- five foot long some of them, twenty- four foot long\u2014 which were fully grouted and they were on four- foot centers. Every four foot in that mile of tunnel or 5,000 foot of tunnel had to be supported so it wouldn\u2019t cave in because of the ground shock that would go through from when you detonated. It would do some funny things. I mean it would turn concrete to water under that much pressure. Concrete would flow just like water. One second ago it was hard, up to so many psi [ pounds per square inch], say twenty thousand psi, and then close to ground zero where some of these containment features were, the concrete, the scientists said it would just flow just like water. I couldn\u2019t figure out how it did it. Yeah, that\u2019s hard for me to wrap my brain around. In fact, if you could get down in 15 Shaft, that was done in granite, at Pile Driver and Hard Hat, those code names. They did it for NORAD [ North American Air Defense Command] over at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado Springs, Colorado. This was a test to see if that communication complex would survive a direct nuclear hit. And they had a round drift, oh, I\u2019d say ten foot in diameter, driven about, oh, eighty feet that I could see. And they lined that drift with concrete and rebar. Rebar was one- inch rebar on about four- inch centers, so it was just a solid mass of rebar and concrete. And when that device went off, it squeezed the tunnel down and took this round cylinder and flattened it. And I dare you to find a crack in that concrete. Now you know UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 13 that if you take a round cylinder of concrete and [ hitting hands together] crush it, it\u2019s going to crack and fracture, but under that pressure and that ground, it didn\u2019t do it. And I used to go take people back there and I\u2019d say, Now, look at this. And you could put water on it, because you can usually see any hairline fractures or something, and I defy you to find a crack in that concrete. How that happened, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just one of the things that under that tremendous amount of pressure, in nanoseconds, just in quick time, it just did some weird things. And other places it just tore it all to billy goat. It did. But in this one particular drift, and it was\u2014 now when they were pointed right at it, they would survive, but when they were crossways, they would destroy it. They know that. So if they\u2019re looking right at the device or at ground zero, the shock waves coming this way, it would survive more so than if it was crossways. If it was crossways, it just wiped it out, like a tsunami. Same thing. It\u2019s much the same kind of energy that you\u2019d get out of a hurricane, a tsunami, tornado. All that huge amount of energy that\u2019s released there in such little places that does weird things. It was. It was mind- boggling to me. And the geologists that did it, they\u2019d shake their head, too, yeah, because you couldn\u2019t second- guess it. You couldn\u2019t get one ahead of them. That was fascinating, but it kept me going, because I [ 00: 10: 00] figured, how in the world would this stuff\u2014? How and why. And in some places it completely failed. Other places it would stand like nothing ever happened. Like you wouldn\u2019t believe that two or I\u2019ll say five hours ago, there was all that energy and electromagnetic pulse and all that stuff was going down the line- of- sight pipe and then five hours later we\u2019re standing there without any protection. Just like nothing happened. No gases, no nothing. That\u2019s how good they got at it. Just like walking back into a laboratory that had a nuclear device go off in it, hours before, five hours before, and we\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdd walk right back in and no reading or nothing. I think Distant Zenith was one of UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 14 them. We went right back in and it was completely clean. Everything worked like they knew what they were doing. So I guess what comes first? Do you mine for ground zero? Is that what it\u2019s called? Yeah, we go all the way to ground zero with both the line- of- sight heading\u2014 that\u2019s where the experiment is\u2014 and then we have what they call a bypass which is driven parallel, about eighty to a hundred feet away parallel, and so when once they field and put in the line- of- sight pipe and then concrete it in, because we\u2019ll pump. Let\u2019s see, concrete and grout in Distant Zenith, there were 10,953 cubic yards of concrete and grout used to seal that tunnel, because you\u2019d put the line- of- sight pipe and that line- of- sight pipe would start at six inches. That\u2019s where the device would go, right here. And then it was like a megaphone. It would go all the way up to twelve foot in diameter. And then they would pump a vacuum on that. It would be down to I don\u2019t know how many microns. It would get right down to simulate outer space. That\u2019s what they were trying to achieve, the same conditions as outer space. Is that on all the tests or this one in particular was supposed to simulate outer space? Most all of them. Most all of them had a line- of- sight pipe in them. Now in the early days back in, oh, the late fifties, they did it many different ways. They were learning. Then once the moratorium [ occurred] where they had to contain them and they had to go underground, they did things a lot different. Had to. OK. So you start at ground zero with the line- of- sight pipe, and then kind of describe to me what the process is to field the experiments once you have ground zero and the line- of- sight pipe. Well, the places for the experiments were designed when they assembled the line- of- sight pipe, usually in Spokane, Washington. That\u2019s where they made a lot of the line- of- sight for the test site was then in Spokane, by Boeing. And they would ship it to the test site. And in the pipe were UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 15 certain grids and brackets and things that are already put in there, strategically put in certain construction stations, and once that was in and cemented up to the end of the pipe to contain it, then there were doors, much like pressure hatches. You would open that door up and scientists could go in and then they\u2019d hang a warhead, a regular end of a warhead, they would hang them in the pipe, with the device in it. They even did that one time. They hung a live device inside of a warhead inside the pipe, because they wanted that shine to hit the warhead, because it does something to it. They disarm them. It disarms them. That\u2019s why they wanted, with the MX [ missile experimental] system, if they did have a, say a submarine launched a missile into outer space or it come off of a satellite. They had missiles and warheads in satellites. They\u2019d deploy ten at once, you know, just from wherever. And they could get close to that satellite and detonate a device and the shine from it would disarm it. Something in the circuit worked the electromagnetic pulse, and again this is way over my head but that\u2019s what they were trying to achieve. Well, if it was over your head, it\u2019s a mile over mine. So with the line- of- sight pipe, is there only one line- of- sight pipe? Note: Photographs and diagrams Mr. Campbell refers to are from The Containment of Underground Nuclear Explosions, U. S. Congress, Office of Technical Assessment, OTA- ISC- 414, GOP, October 1989. Page numbers indicate explanatory images. [ 00: 15: 00] The line- of- sight drift and a line- of- sight pipe\u2014 well, here, that shows you. See, there\u2019s the tunnel, see, and this is a piece of line- of- sight pipe. [ pp. 22, 23] It had to come in in sections, and then the pipe fitters had to weld it all together, see, and then we would go and build bulkheads every so many feet and actually fill the whole annulus or the radius around there full of concrete. So you\u2019d only have the pipe itself open on the inside, and that was open all the way to ground zero. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 16 So you have a ground zero, you have the pipe, and then whatever part of the tunnel, the distance between the tunnel and the pipe would be concreted in. Yes. Because here\u2019s the edge of the tunnel. Now here\u2019s one of your experiment stations. See all the little places for\u2014? And this would be built and\u2014 And that\u2019s the cross- section of a line- of- sight pipe? That\u2019s a cross- section of a line- of- sight pipe, and all these places were for experiments, all the way around these things, and there were several places. There\u2019s one there in the middle, up here [ p. 24]. And there were different ones, different kinds of them like that. Let me see if I can find a place here where it shows more of a line- of- sight. Yes, here\u2019s the portal, see, and there\u2019s one event, two events, three, four. There were four. That\u2019s at P Tunnel. And then there was one more off over here, and the new ones they did is off over here. It Y- ed off right in here by the old walker shack and went out that way. But on the tunnel entrance, there\u2019s a huge door about 1,700 foot in. They call it a gas- sealed door. That\u2019s metal. That swings into place, and the only way you can get back in the tunnel is to open a little hatch and crawl in until during reentry, then they\u2019ll take a crew of people and go in there and open this big, huge door back up. I mean it\u2019s inch- thick metal and it\u2019s a gas- sealed door. It seals all the gases back in. That\u2019s what it\u2019s for. There are several of these along the way. There\u2019s one here. There\u2019s one there. So you got the gas- sealed door, you got the gas- sealed plug, and then you got your overburden plugs and stuff back in here. But see, this here was the line- of- sight drift. See this straight drift right here? That was line- of- sight. This other one parallel to it was called the bypass. Ground zero would be right here. So once this is concreted- in with all this pipe in it, going out to about here, right in there, then these crosscuts in here, scientists can come up here and go over there and get in the pipe through a big door. [ Sound of pages turning] Those are some of the closures. There\u2019s a FAC, UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 17 fast- acting closure. [ p. 44, Figure 3- 7, c] This is part of the line- of- sight, but you\u2019re getting real close to ground zero because that\u2019s probably only about two- and- a- half, three foot in diameter. This is about seven foot from here to here. That\u2019s about a ten- by- ten drift. See the rock bolts that hold the ground and the wire mesh? [ p. 47] I\u2019ve got a picture that can really\u2014 What was the main goal for the Distant Zenith test? Ooh, I bet you that one\u2019s classified. I bet you why they were doing that was classified. It was part of a program. [ p. 21, image and text scrambled], A lot of it had to do with communications, I know that, and it had to do with getting more channels out of the fiber optic, because fiber optic was fairly new yet and they were getting more and more channels from fiber optic, where they used to take a whole bundle of coax, it was that big around. The cables were, oh, half- inch to three- quarters of an inch in diameter, and there would be miles of them, literally just several miles, and then they replaced all that with fiber optic back in the eighties. And I can remember the first fiber optic cable. Man, they treated it like gold. Well, it was. It was more expensive than gold. And then mostly what it all is now, or in the latter years, it was most all fiber optic that they got their [ 00: 20: 00] information out of, and it was a lot clearer and more channels and a lot less chance of cable damage. Because that was our lifeblood, it was the cables, so we had to protect them, oh, all the time. Pardon me if I\u2019m being redundant, but I\u2019m trying to wrap my brain around all this. So the first thing you do, is it the right terminology to say you tunnel in, create the test bed where the device goes, and then what comes next is you put the line- of- sight pipe in? Yeah, once the mining is completed and all the ground hardening, ground support is done\u2014 And that\u2019s where the rock- bolting comes in? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 18 That\u2019s the rock- bolting and concreting. Then we start to concrete and grout. Grout, again, to seal any fissures or any watercourses that were in the mountain, that we\u2019d have to seal them off, and if there was any water leaking, they would try to seal off as much water as they could, because water can cause you to have problems with secondary explosions, because of the steam. That tremendous amount of heat would cause a secondary explosion from water, and that caused them lots of misery in the early days. Some of the areas of Rainier Mesa have more water than others. T Tunnel was the worst. It had more water in it. E Tunnel and T Tunnel. A lot of water. But like I said, once the mining was done and the line- of- sight pipe was installed, then would come your scientists and they would start to what we call field their recording stations and all of the instruments that went in and experiments that went inside the pipe would be installed. And then they would run several dry runs on the cabling, like full- system dry runs, so they\u2019d start down a five- hour countdown where all the scientists would make sure all the little cables and all the idiosyncrasies that they had going on and little magic experiments that they had [ been] playing with, that once they got them where they were happy or they could meet, again the Containment Panel and the Evaluation Panels would say all right. After they had a dry run, they\u2019d have a meeting and say, All right, well, we\u2019ve got problems here, here, and here, and they\u2019d work on them, and then once they got a good dry run, then they would give us the OK to insert, and that\u2019s when they\u2019d bring the device up, because she\u2019s all ready to go, and then the device goes into ground zero. How does the device get into ground zero? Is that through the bypass? Yeah, we\u2019d go down the bypass. See, because it goes all the way to the portal. Because the rest of it\u2019s full of concrete. [ p. 67] And the other thing is, did you play any role in fielding the experiments in the line- of- sight pipe? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 19 We supported. Our pipe fitters, our carpenters, our craftsmen supported the scientists. Whatever they needed, we were there to support them, putting them in, but they would do most of the tech work themselves. We had electricians and pipe fitters that would help them that were kind of specialists, trained. They would help the scientists. But mostly they\u2019d bring their own people to do it. Sandia, Lawrence Livermore, who were some of the other ones? Los Alamos, Jaycor. There must\u2019ve been at least twenty agencies. If there\u2019s an eighteen- month from the time you get the go- ahead to the time of the actual event\u2014 Well, now, there was the event and then reentry [ that] was eighteen months. That was from beginning to end. I mean how long does each of these steps take? Like how long would it take for you guys to kind of get to where you\u2019ve created the test bed? Right at about a year. That takes a year to tunnel in there and do that? To get all the things ready for fielding. Fielding is when the scientists come in. OK. So that takes a year. A year, to do the mining and construction and concreting. Wow. This might be a dumb question but how is it that the tunnel didn\u2019t collapse on you guys? [ 00: 25: 00] Because of the hardening, the ground, the rock- bolt supports. So as you go, you\u2019re doing it? Yes. And then we come back later and do some more. We can advance the tunnel so you can get all the mining done. And then we\u2019d come back in and set up big rock drills. And they\u2019d drill and just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of rock bolts would go out into the ground twenty- four foot and then they\u2019d put a plate on it, a big, huge rock- bolt plate. And they would torque it up UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 20 and it\u2019d pull that ground together, just a like a bolt would on a car, you know, it pulls that ground together, so when the ground force does hit it, it all goes together. It doesn\u2019t wiggle and fall in. It moves together, kind of like it was one piece. Yes, I got you. That\u2019s why if I would\u2019ve had any way to do it, I would\u2019ve taken a camera out there more to record some of the things. A lot of people, you know, you could talk for a week and it\u2019s hard to get through to them how you did it, without having pictures and actual\u2014 and I know that DNA has got video pictures of the actual Alpine \u2122 mining and different sequences that we did. What were some of the challenging things about that first year of the process of actually tunneling in and getting to the test bed? [ Telephone rings] [ 00: 27: 39] End Track 3, Disc 1. [ 00: 00: 00] Begin Track 4, Disc 1. Well, so why don\u2019t you talk a little bit about what your role in the actual mining part, the first year. What were some of the challenges? What was your responsibility? Well, when I was superintendent, you had to coordinate usually three shifts. They had a graveyard and a day shift and then swing shift. So we mined continuously. We always had, from Sunday night till Friday night, we had a crew working underground, mining. Probably a crew of men, oh, somewhere around thirty- five; with all your support electricians and radiation monitors and safety people, we had about thirty- five people to the crew on the back shifts. On day shifts we always had a bigger crew, had more pickup drivers, because everybody had a pickup out there. You\u2019d think that there were 5,000 people working that one job, but no, it\u2019s because there\u2019s a hundred pickups outside, that\u2019s about how many people you\u2019ve got. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 21 Some of the challenges were\u2014 the biggest challenge we had as mining was the safety and the paying attention to detail as far as the size of drift, because the scientists were real particular about, especially in areas close to ground zero, that if it called for a five- by- seven, that\u2019s what they wanted. They wanted it within plus or minus a quarter of an inch. That\u2019s tough to mine. You almost can\u2019t do it with dynamite, but you can with an Alpine \u2122 . You can get it within a couple of inches, but then in places we\u2019d have to do it by hand. We\u2019d have to actually mine through that rock with air spaders, chipping gun, and you\u2019d drive or advance your heading for about, oh, twelve, thirteen feet, because it was that critical. Right off of ground zero. You have to be right in there, because it was a containment. And I once found out why, and I don\u2019t\u2014 it was out at, if I can remember, I went to a meeting down there [ DNA}, and I never could figure out why near ground zero would it matter, but here was your line- of- sight pipe [ p. 45]. And this area right, say, from here to the device was here [ p. 45]. When it went off, this area right here, they knew it was going to fail, most of it\u2019s going to be vaporized. The pipe would actually\u2014 Everything. They knew that the pipe closest to the device would fail. The ground and\u2014 yes. You\u2019re right in here [ p. 46], which is going to be nothing but vaporized, and it\u2019s going to leave a cavity, one that it\u2019ll cave in later. But the reason that this drift right in there had to be exactly what they said, because in the end, after, and they found this out through shock waves, it resembled a woman\u2019s breast. So from here to right there, they knew it was going to fail. If they kept this drift exactly the size they called for, the scientists, then the rest of this energy would be dissipated up and out around. But they had to hold it right in there. And then right down here was your first closure, your FAC, fast- acting closure, and then they had closures, UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 22 your MAC [ modified auxiliary closure] and GSAC [ gas seal auxiliary closure] and your TAPS, tunnel and pipe seal. Those are doors that would close within nanoseconds after the device went off. But this right here, the containment right there, Joe LaComb had it drawn on a board, and Byron Ristvet and those people, they had it, it resembled a woman\u2019s breast. And that\u2019s why he said it had, you guys, we\u2019ve got to be right on the money for about twenty feet right in here. Would the tunnel kind of do that shape, too, or would you just kind of go in and then have the\u2014? [ 00: 05: 00] No, it would start out down here. You\u2019d have about a, oh, five- by- seven where you could walk through it, you know, you wouldn\u2019t have much clearance, about, oh, that wide [ indicating width], and then it would megaphone out up to an eighteen- by- eighteen, sixteen- by- sixteen, according to how big a pipe and what they was going to put in it, determined the size of the drift, each line- of- sight pipe. I know that I\u2019ve got pictures somewhere in there that has good pictures of line- of- sight pipe already installed, where you can see in the pipe and look down it. But it was all just graduated up and over, what, Distant Zenith was 800 feet? Yes, LOS [ line- of- sight] pipe, 800 foot long. So it started out at six inches in diameter and went to twelve feet. Six inches in diameter was ground zero. That\u2019s where they put the device right in front of it. How big is the device? The one I\u2019ve seen was not as big as a basketball but close. Maybe a volleyball? Yes, a small volleyball. Then it just looked like somebody had taken a shiny ball with a bunch of little gadgets hung on it here and there, and they put it in there on a rack, and then they had to adjust it right in. They had little, fine adjustments where they could get her perfect, wherever it had to be. There were two parts to it, A and B. It\u2019s much like a piece of pie. That\u2019s how the scientists explained it to me. Here\u2019s your device [ drawing]. It\u2019s stable here. Take this piece of pie UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 23 out, it becomes unstable, and you bring her back in, it comes critical. And they do that with electricity and maybe a, well, I don\u2019t want to use dynamite, but an explosive, to bring that together. Once it comes together, it becomes critical mass and goes. It\u2019s just like a pie. You got a piece of pie and it\u2019s OK there, but you pull that piece of pie out and it becomes unstable, and you shove her back together and it comes critical. And so you saw the Distant Zenith device, or was that a different test? No, I saw Distant Zenith. OK. And that\u2019s the size of a shiny volleyball, essentially. Is it megatons? Kilotons. A megaton is a million times that TNT. I\u2019m going to guess somewhere around five. I think in one of the books it\u2019ll tell you. There is one of the containment books like this, it\u2019ll tell you [ less than 20 kt]. Yes, I think I have one of those somewhere. It\u2019ll tell you the size of the device, the kiloton, the yield. Let\u2019s see, let me look here. OK, here\u2019s Anchovy. Depth of barrow, purpose, yield, low, so it didn\u2019t tell you yield. Twenty to a hundred and fifty kiloton? Let me see. [ Sound of pages turning] Let\u2019s find some of the tunnel ones. Disko Elm. OK, this was P Tunnel. Less than 20 kt [ kilotons]. Weapons Effect. Depth of barrow, 875. Sponsor, DoD/ LLNL, Lawrence Livermore Nuclear Lab. NTS, U12p. 03. That means Area 12, P Tunnel, 03 Drift. [ 00: 09: 14] End Track 4, Disc 1. [ 00: 00: 00] Begin Track 5, Disc 1. What comes first, digging the line- of- sight tunnel or the bypass, or both at the same time? Both. Same time. You usually have two different crews, a bypass crew and a line- of- sight crew. And what do you call the thing that\u2019s to go from the bypass tunnel to the\u2014? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 24 Crosscut. Those are crosscuts. OK. Crosscut 1, 2, or\u2014 if you look at a detailed map, it\u2019ll tell you, and then in some of those pictures I gave you, there is a detailed map of Crosscut 1, 2. And some of them we have to\u2014 let\u2019s see if I can find [ pages turning], we have to take some of the closures in like a FAC and a GSAC let\u2019s see, I thought I\u2019d seen a picture here [ p. 67]. Are the crosscuts dug at the same time as the bypass, or do you come back later and do that? Usually we would do most of the mining as we go in, see. We usually task one group to go right straight ahead and of course the drift gets smaller. And then the bypass crew will come in and when they get to these [ indicating on diagram [ p. 67]], they\u2019ll mine them through. Because we can have crews working ahead up in here, see, and you can have a crew in there doing some task, rock- bolting. Now when it comes to muck removal, then you\u2019ve got a problem with congestion. Are you mining, digging the crosscuts from the bypass to the other tunnel or from the main tunnel to the bypass? Either way. Doesn\u2019t matter? Doesn\u2019t matter. Yes, it\u2019s whichever comes first and how bad they need it. Yes. But see, like, where these drifts are curved somewhat from the bypass over here to the\u2014 like that [ p. 47]? Those are accesses to bring in late- time closures. Because the FAC, this one here, that\u2019s what makes it closed. Can you read that? It says, \u201c Danger, high explosives.\u201d That\u2019s a sheet of explosive material. Have you ever seen composition C or\u2014? Like plastic\u2014? Same. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 25 OK. Plastic explosives. This is a sheet of plastic explosive. And that\u2019s what makes the door close? It\u2019s wrapped all the way around this pipe, and inside here is a certain kind of copper metal that\u2019s pliable and it\u2019ll seal off. It\u2019ll just squeeze it right down to nothing. When that goes off, of course this is filled full of concrete after this is done, but they have to come in and arm this at late time. The device goes in, then they got to come in and one of the things they\u2019ll do is arm this, because they have this high- explosive blanket in there plus the high- explosive det [ detonation]. Did you say \u201c late time\u201d? Well, what I mean by \u201c late time\u201d is after they insert the device, once the device is inserted, then it kind of changes the picture of everything we do. OK, that\u2019s late time, from the time that\u2014 Once they insert the device, insertion, from then we\u2019ll start stemming at ground zero right then, usually sandbags first so in case there\u2019s a grout leak or a concrete leak, it won\u2019t get back in and destroy the project. Because we\u2019ve had problems in the past where grout did leak into a box, and so we have to be really careful about making sure that we don\u2019t. And they\u2019ve got cameras; they can tell exactly when and what\u2019s happening in A Box. Because they\u2019ve got two security guards camped on top of that device until we\u2014 and once we get the first pour made, then it goes back to you don\u2019t need security except in these places like this where there could be a problem with somebody going in there and not on purpose but things could happen where this explosion could go off, so they have to be careful with this. And so it takes a year to do all the crosscuts, bypass, and\u2014 what\u2019s the name of the big tunnel? LOS. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 26 The line- of- sight tunnel? Line- of- sight. Yes. LOS. [ 00: 05: 00] OK. Then you\u2019re not doing the line- of- sight pipe as you do that? That comes after all of the tunneling is done? After 99 percent of the mining is done, then they\u2019ll start fielding the pipe, or bringing the line- of- sight pipe in. And that is the sign to the craft, the pipe fitters, and miners support them. They bring the pipe in and position it, and then they take a laser beam and line it all up and get her perfect, and then they mount it, and there\u2019s mountings all the way up the tunnel for this pipe to stand on. We bring it in on the rail, take the car, the pipe dollies back out, mount this big line- of- sight pipe on pedestals. Then once it\u2019s filled full of concrete, see, then it\u2019s pretty well in place And the rails, the track is only in the main, the portal tunnel, right? Yes. And most of the track is taken out, especially in the stemming areas. The stemming areas? Stemming is where you concrete. Anyplace where you fill it back full of concrete is a stemming area. End of stemming is where they\u2014 you look on some of your maps, it\u2019ll say \u201c end of stemming.\u201d I don\u2019t have any. Usually I can tell where end of stemming is on\u2014 see, there\u2019s your bypass drift [ indicating on diagram p. 45], your HLOS [ horizontal line of sight]. When the explosion is detonated, radiation travels down the HLOS pipe at the speed of light. These are all the closures, your MAC and GSAC, mechanical closure. MAC is maximum auxiliary closure. GSAC is gas- sealed auxiliary closure. And there\u2019s your end of stemming, a test chamber, end of stemming in the bypass, see, all that black is concrete, and that\u2019s where the end of stemming is. And the same here. Usually end of stemming in the bypass coordinates exactly the same construction station as end of stemming in the line- of- sight. It\u2019s usually real close together. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 27 I would imagine that concreting in the bypass would be one of the last things you do. Last thing. Yes. Is that the absolute last thing you do That\u2019s\u2014 yes. The device is already in there. Because it\u2019s the point of no return, right? Yes, right, that\u2019s the only way you can get in there. The only access you\u2019ve got to get in there is through the bypass. And that bypass is sectioned off in different pours. We might have as many as ten different pours, different types of concrete and different volumes of concrete. But once the first pour is made off of ground zero, then they\u2019re always setting up or getting ready or pouring, for seven days. Usually it takes us about seven days to stem from ground zero to the end of stemming, see, from ground zero here [ indicating on diagram p. 67], because this is already stemmed in or concreted in. All the experiments are in, so at late time\u2014 what \u201c late time\u201d means is anytime after you put the device in is late time, then we\u2019ll start right at ground zero and put in that first containment plug, and it\u2019s usually only about a twenty- or- thirty- yard pour. It ain\u2019t too much. So if we have to go back in and fix a leak or fix a problem, then we still can. But once we start pouring several hundred yards of concrete, you just\u2014 How do you get back through the concrete? Well, you would just mine through it, right? That\u2019s probably easier than normal mining, I would\u2014 no? No, it\u2019s harder. Is it? Yes. Because you\u2019ve got so much metal, rock bolts and different things that interfere with you. Usually what we would do is drive a drift on the outside of it a little bit, another drift on reentry. We would go up as far as we could in the bypass, and then they\u2014 but places we had to follow the UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 28 old drift line again because they had experiments imbedded in the tunnel rib or wall that we had to go by and they\u2019d dig them out later, usually to do with ground motion. [ 00: 10: 00] So they\u2019d have experiments not in the line- of- sight pipe but actually in the\u2014 All over the tunnel. Yes. And would you guys be the ones to put those in there? We would support the users or the experimenters, scientists. They had three names. They called them \u201c users\u201d until the drug culture come about and then they said, no, we can\u2019t use that, no, we can\u2019t use that name, so they called them \u201c experimenters.\u201d Scientists. OK. What was some of the goofy stuff that you saw as experiments? I mean I\u2019ve heard some different stories about the different stuff that was in there. Oh, let\u2019s see, the funniest\u2014 the one that was, they brought a gun barrel off of a Navy ship, one of the big gun barrels. Like a sixteen- inch off of a battleship? Yes. Yes. They took it underground on flatcars. And it was hush- hush about what was going [ on]. And they laid it up in the drift. I can\u2019t remember exactly where it went. Frank Solaegui can really tell you about this because he was more or less in charge of it. I was just on the crew and heard the story later. And got to see it. I got to see it and everything. But once they brought the gun barrel after the event, they went in and captured the gun barrel again, brought it out and they tipped it up on one end and a piece of gold about that big around [ indicating size] rolled out of the barrel. It had all kinds of little wires and, you know. But the gun barrel was, I guess, to hold it in place. But the gold was to take the full flash of light, the shine. And they rolled that gold out there and that, oh, that probably had to be\u2014 I\u2019ll bet you it weighed twenty- five, thirty pounds, forty. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 29 The gold? Yes. That\u2019s a hunk of gold big as a grapefruit. Pure gold. With little holes and wires and\u2014 Just a measure of what\u2014 If gold would be a good insulation, I think, or a good conductor, or what temperatures, or would the gold withstand this flash of light without changing in it somehow? Because that pulse does weird things to a lot of materials. The pulse goes clear through the mountain. It\u2019s actually a ray in a way, I believe, the way I understand it, that electromagnetic pulse has a ray that goes with it that will actually go clear through the earth. It leaves a signature that goes clear through the earth. But yet it\u2019s so small, it can go through your body and never touch a cell. That\u2019s hard to believe. The way the scientists explained it, your cells are about that far apart [ indicating distance] and this ray goes clear through your body and never touches anything. Now I can\u2019t go with that one because I feel like I\u2019m solid mass. Yes, I do, too. That\u2019s yet another thing I can\u2019t wrap my mind quite around. Quantum physics. There\u2019s something there. Well, there in Lead, South Dakota, in that gold mine, [ Homestake Gold Mine] they had a tank of\u2014 what do they use for dry- cleaning fluid? That chemical [ perchloroethylene ( C2Cl4)]. But the scientist [ Raymond Davis] was measuring rays [ neutrinos] from outer space, and I think in the three or four years that they had that experiment going, they had captured two rays that had gone through\u2014 it was fourteen hundred foot underground, in solid granite, and they had a photographic path of this ray going through that big, huge tank, and it had to have several thousand gallons of this\u2014 well, they use it for dry cleaning clothes. Of all the weird things that they used for. But I read\u2014 I think it was in National Geographic, yes, about some of the rays that hit planet Earth, go clear through the earth and UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 30 never touch anything. Now, how\u2019s that? How can you do that? I don\u2019t know. My mind\u2019s not that objective. Well, yes, you know, I see something like this [ knocking on table] and I go, this is solid, right? I mean here it is. And it isn\u2019t. Not to that. This is getting deep [ laughing]. You know, one of the things that I think surprised me and I would imagine would surprise a lot of people is that these tests, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, they weren\u2019t testing the device, they weren\u2019t going, gee, is this device going to work or how can we make the device better? A lot of them were to see the effects of the device on various things. [ 00: 15: 00] Yes. Communications. Radios. They even took a field command post like they\u2019d use out in the field in the Army or Marines or something, where they had a command post with all the communication equipment in it and stuff, they took one of them underground and set it and actually had it bombarded by the shine. Now would that go in the line- of- sight pipe, or that had its own\u2014? No, that had its own\u2014 yes, had its own place, a ramp, yeah, and in fact that was\u2014 And this was underground they did this? Yes. This was at P Tunnel, too. So would that be like the device is like the hub and then there\u2019s spokes coming off and one of the spokes that the shine goes into was where the\u2014? They would come down smaller line- of- sight pipes. I\u2019m trying to think how\u2014 I saw some of them here [ p. 24]. OK, see, actually this flange would be removed and another piece of pipe would be put on there, and we can go on down the tunnel with it, oh, three or four hundred feet, and they put a Plexiglas cover over it, and at late time that cover, because there\u2019s a vacuum on UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 31 this at zero time, there\u2019s a vacuum on inside this pipe somewhere to simulate outer space, but they\u2019d take these off and of course there would be another piece of pipe going on down and it would be right in front of what they wanted to test. Actually that shine would hit what they wanted to test and that was that field command\u2014 it was like a, oh, it was big as, oh, like a work truck you see these guy go around with like a van almost, not a van but it come off of like a big pickup camper? Small camper shell? Not very big. But that would be a command post for all their communications from outer space and that was, I was trying to think, it was when I first got there or the second shot. I don\u2019t know if it was Disko Elm or Mission Ghost or Mission Cyber. It was either Disko Elm, Mission Ghost, or Mission Cyber. I think Mission Ghost was the first shot, so it would\u2019ve been the second one, which would\u2019ve been Mission Cyber [ 12/ 02/ 1987]. That\u2019s where they had that field command in there. And so there\u2019s almost line- of- sight pipes in the line- of- sight pipe. They come off of it. We only have a couple of minutes, so I\u2019m going to stop this CD and put another one in. OK. [ 00: 18: 17] End Track 5, Disc 1. [ 00: 00: 00] Begin Track 2, Disc 2. I don\u2019t have anything left of mining. [ Sound of pages turning] We covered the containment plugs, the mining of the containment plug. Yes. OK. And there was probably about one, two, three, or four of them in the tunnel complex. It was the gas- sealed plug, so it pretty well defines itself. It was supposed to withstand 1,000 degrees, 1,000 psi for so many minutes. I don\u2019t know exactly the time but I know 1,000 degrees and 1,000 psi, and that\u2019s a lot of psi. That\u2019s a lot of psi. And I don\u2019t think that they\u2019ve ever been tested to see if it did. One, Mighty Oak come the UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 32 closest, and it held except for release of some gases in the atmosphere, but it was contained at the overburden plug, but everything else was lost. Everything back in the test bed area was lost. But the gas- sealed plug and the gas- sealed door did hold. Some gases come out. In fact, you can read about that. There\u2019s a lot of articles about Mighty Oak, T Tunnel. That was the worst one we had. In fact, I think it covers Mighty Oak in here in this book. Let\u2019s see, mine, bypass mine, the gas- sealed door, gas- sealed plugs, and mine the LOS and bypass simultaneously, you know, we\u2019re mining both of them together. And the crosscuts as well. And the crosscuts as needed. Crosscut from LOS to the bypass. Overburden plug, gas- sealed plug, your FAS gate, your MACs, GSAC, TAPS, they\u2019re all acronyms for closures. OK. Have we talked about the FAS gate? Is that just the\u2014? They\u2019re all the same. They\u2019re just different names. The FAS gate was the first acronym for GSAC, and they improved upon them, oh, and so they renamed them. FAC is fast- acting closure. GSAC is gas- sealed auxiliary closure. And then you would have the mechanical closure. TAPS is tunnel and pipe seal. GSAC is gas- sealed auxiliary closure. MAC is mechanical closure. MAC. There\u2019s still another definition for MAC, too. The M. Modified auxiliary closure. MAC. Modified. That was a FAS gate and then they called them a MAC, modified auxiliary closure. TAPS is tunnel and pipe seal. In fact, one of the tasks I had over at Pile Driver, when the scientists from Lawrence Livermore lab come down and we started talking this mining jargon and he was reading our logbook because we have to make a daily entry and we did this and this and this here, and so he tasks us to sit down and do a glossary of all the mining terms so he could understand what we were talking about. And I have that somewhere, but I haven\u2019t been able to find it. I know I\u2019ve got a copy of that. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 33 I think it might be in all that stuff [ donated to UNLV]\u2014 It\u2019s there. If you look in there somewhere. I think I remember seeing that. OK, there is a glossary of mining terms. Well, it\u2019s funny because not only does the test site have a lot of jargon, it has a lot of jargon that doesn\u2019t really speak to one another, like you miners had a jargon, the scientists had a different jargon, and so it wasn\u2019t as if there was another language going on at the test site; it was like the Tower of Babel at the test site, it seems like. [ 00: 05: 00] And each one of your crafts had certain tasks and things that they had their own language for. Like the pipe fitters, you know, they would have things to do inside the pipe that we weren\u2019t involved with a lot. We would go in and help support them if they needed, but most of the time they took their, the pipe fitters, they were\u2014 that was a negotiated deal, union negotiation. That was Baneberry there. I saw that [ Containment of Underground Nuclear Explosions, p. 33]. You were out there for Baneberry? I watched it come out of the ground. I was riding in the back of a van, going to work at Ledoux where U1a shaft is. They still got that going. And yes, I was with, oh, Jack Power, Wally Beaman. About four of them are dead now, five of them. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any of them alive but me. One, two\u2014 Pete Peterson is gone, Wally\u2019s gone, Jack\u2019s gone. Jack Severson is gone. I don\u2019t know of anybody but me that\u2019s still alive. Anyway, we were coming over Control Point Hill, CP they call it, control point, and Baneberry was in Area 2 about, oh, five miles as the crow files. And I was about half asleep. Cecil McMurtry, he\u2019s still alive. There\u2019s only two of us that I know of. And Beaman was sitting in the front seat with Jack, the driver, because we UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 34 carpooled in vans, and he said, Holy mercy, look at that. I rose up out of the back seat and the whole desert floor just started to bubble. I mean huge bubble. And then it just kind of collapsed in on itself and come right straight up, and then this is what you see [ indicating photograph p. 33]. You could see boulders flying through the air, big boulders, big as pickups, flying through the air. See, it didn\u2019t come up at ground zero. Ground zero was over here somewhere. It came up through a crack that intersected the drill hole. That was a drill hole. There wasn\u2019t mining done there. It was all done with a drill hole, forty- eight- inch cased hole, and then they\u2019d drop the device down on a rack with a drill rig. That was different than the way we did it. That must\u2019ve put the fear of God into you when you saw that. Yes. Beaman said, Hell, we\u2019re done for the day. Let\u2019s go to Indian Springs or Cactus Springs where you can get a drink. So that\u2019s where we went, to Cactus Springs. But man, it was pandemonium. There were security guards driving everywhere with their lights on. They didn\u2019t know what to do. They were trying to route people this way. That was in the day where they let people out fairly close to ground zero. And the last day, since Baneberry, there was nobody past Mercury, except for your scientists up in the control point. But there was nobody out in the forward area. Nobody. They swept all the forward area. And forward area would be beyond control point, or actually forward area is beyond Mercury, is called forward area. OK. Well, it seems like that\u2019s how we most often learn lessons is from mistakes. Yes. Hindsight. Yes. Well, so was there anything else you wanted to talk about as far as the mining the first year of the work in a test? Do you want to like maybe describe a typical day for you? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 35 Well, OK, that would be a good point, is to kind of brief\u2014 for safety reason, say we were mining a ten- by- ten drift, which is about one of the normal- sized drifts. We did more ten- by- ten mining, ten high, ten wide, than most of the other sizes. We got bigger than that but not a lot. Most of our mining was done in ten- by- ten, because you could get equipment down it, you could get personnel a lot easier instead of the small drifts. You\u2019ve come in, say, and they would be advancing, either drill and blast or with an Alpine \u2122 miner, a mechanized continuous miner, and you\u2019d advance your heading about, oh, eight feet. At a time you\u2019d mine, oh, about eight foot of [ 00: 10: 00] what they call ahead of wire, the chain link fencing that we use to support the ground, and rock bolts. That Alpine \u2122 miner stuck out about ten to twelve feet, so your operator on the miner was always protected. He was under protected ground at all times. So then he would back that Alpiner out. It was on tracks, electric motors, and he\u2019d back it out. Then we would go in there with jacklegs and miners and drill and install ground support rock bolts and then put the wire mesh up, and that way you could safely mine back. It wasn\u2019t dangerous. You had to be careful, because you could get a ground fall or a slab or something on you, a slab being a piece of rock that would fall on you. Like how far would you go in any given day? Oh, on an average, when everything was going real good, we would average, completed tunnel, about six to seven feet per shift of completed tunnel. Some days you\u2019d do more, some days less, but then I think the average there was about six to seven feet a day. When you\u2019re going with the Alpine \u2122 miner, then you have to back it out in order to\u2014? You only back it out about twenty feet. How fast is this thing? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 36 Real slow. About like, you know, a real slow walk was it was going fast. Yes, it was like a crawler. It crawled on tracks and you could ease it up, but it was a real slow walk, and you can crawl on your hands and knees about as fast as it can go wide open. About the same speed. OK. And this thing, I mean if you\u2019re running on three shifts, this thing is running semi- constantly, then. Yes. You\u2019d probably cut for an hour and a half, two hours, back it out, rock- bolt, hang your utilities, which the utilities would be your vent line to pull the dust out, air and water line, you need water line for fire, and to drill in rock with a rock drill, you need water to suppress the dust. And we needed atomizers on the Alpine \u2122 miner that sprayed because this big head would create a tremendous amount of dust because it just chewed the rock up, the volcanic tuff, and that\u2019s very high in silica, so to control the rock dust and the diesel smoke and all the pollutants that we had underground, we did it through a ventilation system. So whenever you got to the end of a twenty- foot section of pipe, then you had to bring another one in and put it in place, and then they\u2019d take a telescopic piece and shove down it, so when you advance you could pull this out as you go. And then once you got to the end of it, down come another pipe and you put your telescope pipe back in, and then you keep advancing that way. That\u2019s for your ventilation. And then you\u2019d have to carry with you air and water: compressed air to run your jacklegs or your drills, and a lot of your machinery underground is air- driven, a lot of your concrete pumps, the conveyors to them are air- driven, your Moran cars, a Moran car being a car that contained concrete. It was a concrete truck on rail, is what it was, and it had a big air motor to it and you hook a two- inch air hose to it under ninety pounds of compressed air, turn a motor on, and that actually rotated that big barrel with concrete in it, twelve yards of concrete. And that\u2019s how we\u2019d UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 37 take a lot of our concrete underground is on rail, big rail like you see running up and down the Union Pacific, only smaller. And run by air. And run by air. Is that because you don\u2019t want the fumes of\u2014? That, and no gasoline underground. More combustible and stuff? Diesel only, a number- two graded diesel. And then you had to scrub it, run it through, oh, percolate it through water with soap and stuff in it, soda and soap, and they put a\u2014 The diesel fuel you would have to do this? [ 00: 15: 00] Well, the exhaust, see, had to be scrubbed. And then you had to have so many cubic feet per minute of ventilation to meet the OSHA [ Occupational Safety and Health Administration] standards and mine, health, and safety standards. So we were under a lot of [ standards]\u2014 and then our own rules. The government, they had a rule book this thick [ indicating thickness] and of course Reynolds Electric [ REECo], they\u2014 whichever is the safest. Because for many years, no other entity could get out there except for who they wanted. We run our own safety program, and did pretty well. Finally in the eighties, when the Tiger Team\u2014 I don\u2019t know if you ever heard of the Tiger Team that Congress mandated to go around to all the nuclear facilities and inspect them? Oh, they came out and they tore us up. Oh! Because we weren\u2019t living by their standards. They did. It took us, I don\u2019t know how much money it took, which is OK. A lot of it was redundant, I mean because we had all kinds of exotic chemicals, gases, bottles and bottles of helium, hydrogen, all kinds of welding gases, you had epoxies, and all this, and when you take it underground, all kinds, and blasting gas from dynamite when you\u2019d blast UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 38 dynamite, that puts off a heck of a gas and it burns all the oxygen. So you\u2019ve got to maintain your dust level, the level of diesel smoke, because there was a lot of diesel. You get six, seven, oh, we had one, two, three, usually about five motors, maybe six diesel motors. And I mean by \u201c motor\u201d that runs up and down the track, pushing them big twelve- yard Moran cars, or pushing muck cars to haul the dirt out, haul the material in, flatcars. There again, I wish I had some pictures or something to show you of how a tunnel train would be made up, because you had to pull everything. Mostly everything you had to pull in. You couldn\u2019t push a muck train in except for a Moran car, and that\u2019s the only one you could push in. Moran car? \u201c Moran car\u201d being the concrete hauler. They were called Moran cars, I don\u2019t know how\u2014 maybe from the maker? I don\u2019t know who made them. We called them Moran cars. And all they are was a twelve- yard concrete hauler that could actually dump the concrete into a conveyor belt, which would dump it into a pump, which would squirt it back into the pour. Some of the pours would go anywhere five, six, seven hundred yards. If you could pump a Moran car every fifteen minutes, you were doing really good. Everything was going clickety- clickety- click because, you know, you get one of them things off the track and they weight thirty ton. Oh, geez. That\u2019s just what I said, oh, geez. And it\u2019s going to get hard on you. You\u2019re under the gun for time, you know, you\u2019re under the gun. Once they put that device in it, it just\u2014 the thing gets just a little bit\u2014 they screw the old a little tighter. Which, to me, it was a challenge. Yes. Wasn\u2019t it exciting, too, it seems like? Oh, yeah, yeah, you\u2019d get bored once in a while, but not very often. You didn\u2019t have time to get bored. It\u2019s kind of like this place around here, see, it was the same. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 39 What was your title, mining supervisor, mining superintendent? Mining superintendent. How much time did you spend in the tunnels as opposed to an office or something like that? OK, I would get to the job about 7: 30 in the morning. There would usually be the graveyard walking boss, which was my assistant, that was there all night. I just showed up about 7: 30 in the morning on day shift. And I\u2019d talk with him, then I\u2019d usually have a walking boss, which they were assistant superintendents, and there was one or two to each crew, so we\u2019d always have two or, well, not two, we\u2019d have one there all the time. That had to be a salaried supervisor [ 00: 20: 00] underground at all times. So when I get to the job, the graveyard walker would come out and tell me and the day shift walker coming on where they were at, if we were\u2014 OK, you\u2019re rock- bolting here, you\u2019re pouring concrete over here, you\u2019re doing this over here. We\u2019d have several, oh, forty or fifty tasks sometimes going on at the same time in different parts of the tunnel. And then that would be for eight hours, and during the mining part there wasn\u2019t a lot for us to do, I mean as far as directing traffic, because it was repetitious, over and over and over. We just had to make sure that they were on target and had plenty of material because you know you\u2019re 125 miles from anywhere, or 105. From that front door over there to P Tunnel is 105 miles. And you know if you have to run to town to get a handful of bolts, you can\u2019t wait five hours for them to get back, so we had to have quite a warehouse system out there to keep us going. It was quite a storage area. In fact, N Tunnel, when they started demobbing it, there must\u2019ve been fifteen to twenty acres of stuff. Demobbing? Demobilizing? Demobilizing. Yes. We started buttoning up and moving out and they give a lot of the stuff away, barrels and barrels of oil and antifreeze. It was fifteen to twenty acres, say, you take two UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 40 city blocks right here in this neighborhood, and there were all kinds of material on it. Every kind of thing. Sheet metal from this thick to that thick [ indicating thicknesses]. I got pictures somewhere of the lower yard at N Tunnel, and it was probably at least fifteen acres of stuff. Was there one big place that serviced all the different tunnels or was there one per? Most of it came out of Mercury, Warehouse Division, but we had our own people that ordered. They would order what we needed according to what phase of mining we were in. When we were actually doing the mining and construction, we applied a lot of gunite, and I never did ever cover that. That was what covered the tunnel walls with. It\u2019s sprayed on, much like a swimming pool when you gunite a swimming pool or pump the concrete on homes. It would be blown on. You\u2019d blow on about, oh, anywhere from three to six inches of fibercrete or gunite all over the tunnel. Is that after the rock- bolting? After the rock- bolting, yeah. And again, sometimes the hardening came on after that, when you\u2019d harden the tunnel. First you\u2019d go through and support it so it wouldn\u2019t cave in on you. Then you\u2019d gunite it. And then you\u2019d come back and set up them big drills and they\u2019d drill the twenty- four- foot fully- epoxied or full- grouted bolts on three- by- four or four- by- four centers all the way from the invert, which is the floor, all the way around to the other floor. They didn\u2019t harden the bottom too much. Some places they did. Not too much. And the gunite\u2019s purpose, was it to harden the tunnel, was it to diminish dust, was it\u2014? To harden the tunnel, so when on reentry, when you come back in, you don\u2019t have ground fall or cave- in. Because it would, it would really bind everything together. Because that wire mesh or chain link fencing was in there and gunited through that, and that helped it, and the rock bolts helped it. You\u2019d have places where it would ground fall, but that gunite saved our bacon a lot of UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 41 times on how it supported the ground. And it kind of moved kind of like it was elastic; it moved together. Some places where you have a fault, you\u2019d see a shear, and then you might have a problem over here where, oh, several hundred ton come out of the roof or even the bottom heaves up four and five feet, but the bottom just comes right up against the back. It\u2019s hard to tell where and when it\u2019s going to happen. The geologists, they had it pretty well figured out after a while, about which kind of ground, which conditions would heave on you during zero time from [ 00: 25: 00] the ground motion from the device, because your ground\u2019s going to move around in there three and four feet. Sometimes they just [ claps hands together] close the tunnel up, just like you weren\u2019t even there, just a pile of rubble, and we\u2019d have to mine back through that, and that got to be a little bit dangerous sometimes. They\u2019d be careful, and it was slow. As far as our safety record out there, we had as good in the industry as there was. We got lucky, though. Got lucky. All you need is a little bit of luck, right? Lot of luck. Lot of luck. Yes. Because I\u2019ve even seen some close calls and I said, how in the heck did we ever get by it? But yes, if you could ever get out and go into that tunnel, see, this is your air and water line that goes up the tunnel. That\u2019s your ventilation. Big, huge 200- horsepower axle- veined fans, 100- horsepower axle- veined fans, four and five of them. I mean you could throw your hard hat underground and it\u2019d suck it down that pipe so fast. Working around it, I\u2019ve lost several hard hats. It\u2019ll suck it right off your head. Well, so shall we move to maybe what happens after the tunneling, the mining\u2014? Well, I think we\u2019ve pretty well got, you know, except going into the real intricacies of\u2014 we\u2019ve covered that pretty much. The final bit of mining and you get the\u2014 UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 42 Yes, the little assorted tasks that we would do, you know, required drilling and blasting. There was always something going on somewhere. And then a lot of core drilling went on, because from the bypass to the line- of- sight pipe, where there was cabling, electrical cables or coax cables or communication or scientific cables, data cables I guess you\u2019d call them. They would drill from the bypass a hole, oh, say, from four to six inches in diameter, some up to twelve, fourteen inches in diameter, through the rock to the line- of- sight pipe, or to that line- of- sight drift, and then they would bring cables out and go to different places in the pipe for their experiments. But they would do a lot of core drilling, and then that was done by the operating engineers. They call them diamond drills, and where the diamond part come, because they had a diamond bit on it, a diamond core bit, diamond- impregnated, so it would actually core over the rock and you could bring the rock out. In fact that\u2019s what these boxes are right here [ indicating items on shelf]. They\u2019re core sample boxes. Oh, so they just can just take them right out? Say they drill ten foot and they pull out the core barrel, they take and this box is sectioned off probably in a tray of one, two, three, four, four, I think it\u2019s about that big. I\u2019ve got a little bitty core but I don\u2019t have any big ones [ walking away]. That\u2019s a small core out of 15 shaft [ walking back and showing core]. That\u2019s granite. That actually came out of 15. Pile Driver. That seems perfectly symmetrical. It is. And that\u2019s hard. That\u2019s harder\u2014 that\u2019s what they call bird\u2019s eye blue granite and it is hard. You can take a regular rock drill that hits and turns and you have water on it, and there\u2019ll be fire spitting out of that hole that far [ indicating distance], with water in it. And so these were smaller, I don\u2019t even know what you call them but core- drilling\u2014 UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 43 Yes, most of them they did for recovery samples. This was done for\u2014 that was recovery, to see if the\u2014 when they stored the nuclear casks from power plants, they stored them at Climax. There was a test called Climax or a test bed, it was in 15 shaft, they stored these radioactive caskets in these ground holes for a year, I think, and they were about 1,300 degrees, and there\u2019s some exposure, but then they went back in later and core- drilled into the rock different depths to see if [ 00: 30: 00] the radiation and what effect the heat had upon the ground structure. Did it move it? Did it twist it? Because they were measuring everywhere on that tunnel all the time. And they put I think it was five of those caskets that were full of radioactive material, and they did it for a year, and then they pulled them out. They were from Turkey Point, Florida, out of their nuclear reactor in Turkey Point, Florida. We had five of them onsite for a long time. Where they ended up, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know where they took them to. Eventually maybe Yucca Mountain. Maybe. That\u2019s where it was supposed to go eventually because that\u2019s what Climax was, was the prototype for Yucca Mountain, in granite. Yucca Mountain\u2019s in the volcanic tuff. That come out of over by Pile Driver. Red Hot, Pile Driver, Hard Hat were three of the codenames and that was back in the fifties, \u2019 58, \u2019 59, \u2019 60, \u2019 61, \u2019 62, \u2019 63, maybe up to \u2019 64, they had three or four events in 15 shaft. Area 15. I bet I could find it in there. Pile Driver. [ Sound pages turning] In \u2019 59 [ 1966], I think. And so the line- of- sight pipe doesn\u2019t get put into the line- of- sight drift, tunnel. Is there a difference between a drift and a tunnel? Same. Drift. Tunnel. So are the crosscuts, bypass, and line- of- sight tunnel, are all those completed before you start putting the line- of- sight pipe in? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 44 Ninety- nine percent. There\u2019s always little tasks here and there, you know. Mighty Oak. Mint Leaf, that was a T Tunnel, 1970. That\u2019s where they had that Russian submarine missile. That was Mint Leaf at T Tunnel and that was May 5, 1970. Mission Ghost, \u2019 87. OK, I believe that was the first event at P Tunnel. Nineteen eight- seven. I was there. Hard Hat, 1962. That was the first one at\u2014 Red Hot. Maybe it might\u2019ve been Red Hot. That was before my time. I went out there in \u2019 67, so I don\u2019t\u2014 and a lot of them, all I ever heard was the stories and seen the aftereffects. Good. Now why don\u2019t we maybe transition to what comes next. What happens after, you said it takes about a year, after you start putting the line- of- sight pipe in. The mining takes anywhere from nine months to a year to complete the mining. OK. So how does your job transition once you start putting the line- of- sight pipe in? We\u2019re in support, and as soon as they put the pipe in, then our job as a mining cadre was to stem the tunnel. That means to grout or concrete the line- of- sight pipe into place and to construct and pour the containment plugs, and that was done with concrete. Are there types of concrete? They had a menu of concrete. I used to have a copy of it. There had to be over 150 different flavors of concrete. And each one of them had a name. Let\u2019s see, one of them I can remember was Midnight Zephyr Extra High Strength Groutcrete with ChemComp. And that\u2019s how they would write it, MZEHSG\u2014 Midnight Zephyr Extra High\u2014 and it seemed like every once in a while they\u2019d have an event, like Midnight Zephyr, and so they\u2019d name a concrete after it because Waterways Experiments [ U. S. Army Corps of Engineers] and USGS [ United States Geological Survey], they would [ 00: 35: 00] have quite a cadre of people working on concrete. Some of it they wanted\u2014 well, they had one concrete called Super Lean, and that was six yards of washed sand and one sack of UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 45 concrete. So when you poured it and it set up in the better part of a day, you could actually pull the form off and take and scrape it with your fingers, it was so soft. But it held. It\u2019s not like pouring wet sand and then when it dries out it\u2019s going to fall. This Super Lean was just\u2014 that\u2019s what it was. And it was used in certain places along the tunnel. Now in your containment plugs they had to have a different strength of concrete. Some of it in seven days it got up to 25,000 to 28,000 psi. Some high, hot stuff. That one I can remember, Midnight Zephyr Extra High Strength Groutcrete with ChemComp. ChemComp is a retardant to slow down the hardening process of it. Why would you want to slow down the hardening? So you would be able to work with it? So we can work it, yes, because some of it was real hot. And we had to pour it at a certain slump. They had all kinds of inspectors inspecting us pouring concrete. And they checked every load that come in, because it had to meet the containment committee\u2019s standards for hardness, the ability to seal the rock, and yet be like the rock. See, they didn\u2019t want it to get any harder than the rock, so they wanted to simulate the natural volcanic tuff. What would happen if it was harder than the rock? In some places, from the power, from the device explosion, would get between the concrete and the rock and form a pathway. So if it\u2019s the same, it doesn\u2019t. It won\u2019t get between the interface, I guess I want to call it, where the concrete comes up against the side of the tunnel, and it can go right down that tunnel and get into where it\u2019s not supposed to be. And there was certain places they wanted harder concrete, but most of the stemming was to stay as close as they could to the rock hardness, the same hardness that the volcanic natural was, that\u2019s what we had to pump concrete in. But I used to have a blueprint with all those types of concrete, and there was about a hundred different flavors of concrete. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 46 That\u2019s crazy. Yes, it was. And every time we\u2019d have a new shot, they\u2019d have a new flavor of concrete. So this isn\u2019t the type of concrete you can buy down at Home Depot or anything. This is like super- duper concrete? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is all kind of exotic concrete. They had fly ash in it. They had all kinds of stuff in it. So it wouldn\u2019t shrink. See, a lot of concrete will shrink, and once the water has dissipated, it\u2019ll shrink. Well, that would leave a gap between the rock line, or the interface, there\u2019d be a little bit of a gap. They couldn\u2019t have that. That would be bad. Yes. So we\u2019d even have to go in later and pressure- grout those places, set up big pumps with a real fluid type of concrete and pump it high, oh, 1,000 psi, 1,200 psi, 800. We weren\u2019t going to get too high because that would again fracture the rock, see. You get too much pressure. So they\u2019d make us go right up to a certain psi and then hold it right there. And sometimes we\u2019d have to hold on them for hours because they\u2019d bleed off and you got to pump them up again and they\u2019d bleed off and pump them up. So it\u2019s labor- intensive, and it goes on twenty- four hours a day. A lot of hours and hours and hours of pressure- grouting went in to seal the plugs, to seal the concrete and the rock interface. We couldn\u2019t have any voids. Couldn\u2019t. Couldn\u2019t afford a void. That would get us into more hot water than we could get out of, because we did it several times. We left some of the pipes empty and we didn\u2019t know it. On reentry, you know, when you\u2019re mining back through it and you see one of the pipes that ain\u2019t got\u2014 ohhh, boy! Here them inspectors are writing down\u2014 and then they have a meeting about it. Oh, yeah, that could really get us in somewhat of hot water with the containment. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 47 Yes, I bet. Well, and if on a good day, let\u2019s see, you said about six to eight feet of drilling a day, that\u2019s what, eighteen to twenty- four feet a day, somewhere in there? Maybe just say an average of twenty? [ 00: 40: 00] That would be a good figure. How quickly does the line- of- sight pipe go? And which way are you going? Do you go from\u2014? We work towards ground zero. Towards ground zero. OK. Except when you retreat, you know, once you put the device in, all you can do is go out. So we start at ground zero and pre- grout or pre- stem, they\u2019d call it pre- stemming. You pre- stem all the line- of- sight pipe into place. You do all the concreting you can ahead of time. That\u2019s so when they bring the device in, the only thing you\u2019ve got to do is plug up your pathway, the bypass drift and some of the crosscuts. Most of the crosscuts are already pre- stemmed up for, let\u2019s see, the one into the FAC, we usually have to pour usually simultaneously while we\u2019re readying a pour in the bypass after they\u2019ve inserted the device. We\u2019ll make a pour over here and then one over here and one there and one back here and then it all comes together, but we have to stagger our pours. What I mean by stagger them, you\u2019ve got a pour here so it can be hardened and so they can be getting ready for another pour behind it, because the pours were about a hundred foot long, and you went back in there, say, a thousand feet, so we had ten pours, roughly. It varied from, I\u2019d have to get a map and look at the bulkheads on there, the stemming bulkhead, but they\u2019re roughly about a hundred feet. Some of them, the anchor plugs, which would be the last plug in the stemming, we called that anchor plug, that\u2019s the one that\u2019s got to hold. Some of them up in there can fail a little bit, but that one better not fail or the tunnel\u2019s in trouble. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 48 I\u2019m sorry if I missed the answer, but like when you start the line- of- sight pipe and you\u2019re going towards the test bed, the device, the device is not in yet. No. How quickly are you moving on that? How quickly does that go? OK, once they start fielding your line- of- sight pipe, it would take the fitters and the miners about, oh, I\u2019d say anywhere from seven to nine months to install the pipe, because they come in in about fifty- foot sections, thirty- foot sections, so they had to be welded. You know, a twelve- foot weld all the way around is a lot of welding. And for the pipe fitters to get in there. They\u2019d weld twenty- four hours a day. But it\u2019d take to install, to line, because they had to line that pipe, you know, they shined a laser beam right down the center and they had crosshairs. They\u2019d hang a crosshair on the pipe and they\u2019d have to be right on, dead right, zero tolerance, putting that laser beam down that pipe. And that\u2019s how they could get that big pipe centered. And then we\u2019d concrete around it so it wouldn\u2019t move. Because they had to pump a vacuum on it later. And so you did the two things relatively simultaneously? You would concrete and go back with the\u2014 no, that can\u2019t be right. No, we\u2019d install the pipe\u2014 And then you\u2019d concrete. Then we\u2019d weld it, and once they\u2014 So you\u2019d install the whole pipe, then you\u2019d weld. OK. And then they\u2019d pump a vacuum on it to make sure there were no pinholes and leaks in the pipe. And then they would say, all right, the pipe is sealed. Then we would go back in and build bulkheads about every hundred feet, and then we\u2019d pump up a hundred foot and that\u2019d hold that, and then retreat out and pump another hundred foot and another hundred foot until you get to the end of stemming and the line- of- sight pipe is there. It\u2019s encapsulated in concrete, different UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 49 flavors and hardnesses of concrete, some that it\u2019s soft for a reason. And in fact there\u2019s even one section in one of the FAS gate or the MAC where they just blow sand in, just regular desert fines, because they wanted that little twenty- foot area for this high- det explosion to collapse that pipe. And then they wanted the gases to start to go out into the rubble zone, but then not to go beyond that. You can get out this far, but don\u2019t go beyond that. And they got to where they could target. It\u2019s incredible, isn\u2019t it? In fact, one of the things that used to get me about it, in the craters down in where you seen the pictures of the bomb craters, they\u2019d come up and they\u2019d take the laborers out there and they\u2019d [ 00: 45: 00] build a fence around the area that was going to crater, and when that thing subsided, caved in on itself after zero time, oh, sometimes two or three hours, the whole thing would just cave in on itself. You could go right up to within about three or four feet of that fence and the rest of it was just a big crater. And how in the world do they know it\u2019s going to crater out this far? They\u2019re good. Because it know it wasn\u2019t the laborers that did that, but so many feet from ground zero they had to have a fence for later, and that\u2019s exactly\u2014 let\u2019s see if I have one here. This shows you a picture of some of the [ sound of pages turning] at Baneberry. Like if this is the main tunnel, and then this is the line- of- sight tunnel, right, if that\u2019s the main tunnel, this one, and that\u2019s the line- of- sight tunnel [ indicating on diagram], do you concrete all the way back to here? End of stemming. End of stemming can vary. OK, so that\u2019s like the map you showed me somewhere. OK. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 50 Yes, and they all vary different, according to what the size of the yield they anticipate to be, how much do we need, 800 feet this way, 1,000. See, you got 800 feet of overburden above you, you need that much here, and they\u2019d usually go about 10 percent over. That was a rule of thumb that I figured, or at least we\u2019re going to give you another hundred feet to play with, at least a hundred foot on what they call the anchor plug or the end of stemming. Same thing. And that end of stemming, that\u2019s where it really has to\u2014 That\u2019s got to stop anything that might get away, other than if it comes down the line- of- sight pipe, and if it comes down the pipe and the pipe ruptures, there ain\u2019t much you can do about it. See here [ sound of pages turning]. See all these craters? Those are old bomb craters. It looks like the moon. It does look like the moon. Yes. And they\u2019d have a fence all the way around that thing. [ 00: 47: 22] End Track 2, Disc 2. [ 00: 00: 00] Begin Track 2, Disc 3. All right, so we have the line- of- sight pipe in. Let me see if I get the terminology right. You\u2019ve concreted back to stemming? End of stemming. To end of stemming. I was close. End of stemming or anchor plug, either one. Is the bypass tunnel still\u2014? Open. Open. So that\u2019s the last thing you do, because you need some access to get\u2014 UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 51 You have to have access to insert the device and get your scientific people back in, and then as they come out, then they have to arm certain cables, make certain splices, or not splices probably at that time but they have to arm the FAC, MAC, GSAC, TAPS, they have to arm them. OK, they\u2019re already armed. You have to go into a firing box and put that in readiness, and then that firing box would be concreted in, but they have to pull the shunts out and all the safety devices, protective devices, and then get it ready to go, and then we retreat out of the bypass. But there\u2019s probably four places along there we\u2019ve got to stop and let the scientists make their adjustments on the closures, because that\u2019s all done from the bypass side, or close to it, where we can get a firing box in there. And right now, at this stage of the process, you can still go into the line- of- sight tunnel, right? Or pipe, excuse me. And go almost all the way back, right? Well, you can go back till it gets too small to crawl. But yeah, you can go back, like I said, that far. Do people ever need to do that, to tinker with the experiments or anything? Yes, Yes, Yes, because there are gauges back in there, there are gauges and experiments that they have to get back in to be at, yeah. So actually they have big doors. I saw one on this one here. See, these are entrance doors. See that one? You can imagine one, oh, they looked more or less like, if you had your big line- of- sight pipe, they have just a big hatch that you would be able to seal it because they had big wing nuts, much like a hatch on a ship, a bulkhead hatch, exactly the same thing. So they could put a vacuum on that pipe, because it had to seal, because they had to put a vacuum on the inside of that pipe before zero time, down to I don\u2019t know how many microns. It got down to an almost perfect vacuum. Real close. Was that one of the reasons why they put the vacuum on it, is to make sure there was no\u2014? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 52 Nothing. Yes. So it\u2019s not so much to simulate outer space as it is to make sure there\u2019s no\u2014 or it\u2019s both, I guess, but to make sure there\u2019s no punctures or\u2014 Because a lot of the testing was done for outer space, so they had to simulate that as close as they could. OK. And is there a sense of, I would imagine that some tests needed to be closer to\u2014 at that point, does proximity matter, you know, the experiments in the line- of- sight pipe? As long as the shine can hit them, because they all have to have a little real estate. In that one picture you\u2019ve seen that they\u2019re this was always a good\u2014 How did the welds hold? Good. They got some of the best welders in the country, and they did it all with wire feed, heliarc. See all these little experiment stations? Anything back here or up ahead of it can\u2019t interfere with this shine. It has its own little\u2014 all the way to ground zero. Each one of these, even the stub pipes, and they\u2019re along the outside of the pipe. But each one of these things was placed in a strategic position to where when this shine comes down the pipe, you don\u2019t get a shadow from one interfering with the other. In fact, see, you couldn\u2019t put one right behind here. They all had to have\u2014 They each had to get their own part of the light, the shine, the light. Right. And that\u2019s why they got into the twelve- foot pipe, see, they could have more area down there, where if they put them all up front, they wouldn\u2019t. So the bigger the pipe, usually the more [ 00: 05: 00] experiments they had. And they usually had two test chambers. This is a major test chamber and then they\u2019d have one\u2014 in fact, the door to that test chamber is right in front of this. Yes. I\u2019ve probably been in this pipe right here. I bet I have [ p. 24]. UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 53 So where are we in the process? If the line- of- sight pipe is done, if the concrete has been poured to end of stemming, how many months out are we now? How close are we to the event and how far away from here? We\u2019re within three to four months of execution. Whatever it takes for the electrical people, the techs to get all their stuff ready, their experiments all ready and in and tested, so they\u2019ll go through several dry runs. Probably every day they\u2019ll have three or four dry runs. And the dry runs start occurring at that point where you have\u2014? Once all the fielding is done, what I mean by fielding, all the experiments are in, and then they\u2019ve pumped a vacuum on the pipe, and then they\u2019ll have a dry run. Everything\u2019s working good, everything looks good. Then once they\u2019ve determined that the experiments and the experimenters are done, all the recording stations are set to go, the computers, in big, huge alcoves or drifts, sometimes they call it a dance hall, too. It was about, oh, thirty foot wide, probably two hundred foot long, and it\u2019d be plumb full of little trailers, a trailer much like a little square house trailer, only about, oh, about twenty foot long, eight- by- eight- by- twenty, fifteen, and inside these was all their recording stations and computers. Mostly recording stations. And then all the cables were run to them. And then there was a cable run from them on to the surface, into the mesa, because they had trailers sitting up there that would record, too, outside, up on the mesa, because they had a drill hole through from the surface down with cabling going up that they could connect to and put more recording trailers on the surface. But that was usually outside of the crater area. But one time they didn\u2019t. RADSAFE went up there and they were in one of the trailers checking it out when it started to crater. Killed one of them. There were about four people went down in it. I think one was killed. One broke his leg. That was at T Tunnel, too, but I don\u2019t know UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 54 if it was Mighty Oak or it was the one before Mighty Oak. But yeah, the kid that got hurt, I knew him in Pahrump. He died. He was a RADSAFE. And they have to go back. That\u2019s when they really come into focus is when on reentry, because of the possibility of radiation leaks, gas leaks and stuff. And there was always some, but most of it was minute. It\u2019ll tell you in this book here if there was any [ DOE/ NV\u2014 209- Rev 15 December 2000]. OK. And so if the dry runs have gone off without a hitch\u2014 Then they give us the go- ahead and they order the device and bring it up on the job, usually about, oh, it shows up about seven in the morning, and we take it underground and they\u2019re ready to start pumping concrete or stemming, they give us the OK to start stemming. Is there a tension when the device shows up? Yes. I mean are the same people allowed to show up at work, or is it\u2014? Usually no, except the need to know and the need to be there, you\u2019re escorted in and out. They got a visual authority, a VO. I don\u2019t know what that acronym means. VO is visual authorization. OK. So you had a badge. You wore your badge. And then they\u2019d log you in and log you out. So you had to be on a list of some kind to get in there. And the number of cadre was at a minimum. Always at the bare minimum. We had people standing by down twenty miles away or ten miles away, or in a bus sitting at the bottom of the hill somewhere, all your craftsmen, but they were ready to go pumping concrete. As soon as we got ground zero buttoned up, then they would turn it over to us. [ 00: 10: 00] When the device came, how much time between that morning, that seven a. m. in the morning when the device shows up to where the event\u2019s actually going to take place? Are we weeks away? Are we months away? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 55 It took us somewhere on the average of seven days to button the tunnel up. We retreated and pumped all that concrete in about seven days. Then your gas- sealed containment plugs had to have a cure of about three days to reach the hardness to contain any possible leaks. It had to get somewhere around the 20,000 psi range, the hardness of the concrete. If the device got there at seven, at what point would they leave and the device already, you know, how long would it take for them to show up, install the device, and then have you have your crew come back and be able to start working? They call it emplacement. Three or four hours. Short time. It doesn\u2019t take them long to assemble it, but there\u2019d have to be a protocol, usually a DNA or a Navy or an Army, DoD personnel has to be there. Usually it\u2019s the engineer in charge. You know, I knew several. On this one here, Ricky Richards, Lieutenant Richards, he was the [ DNA test] engineer that I answered to, the first line of engineer. He kind of was the captain of the ship, well, in the engineering part. I would\u2019ve been the captain of the ship and I had a boss, a project manager, which oversaw all of the\u2014 each one of the crafts usually had a superintendent. I was over the carpenters, the miners, the laborers, some electricians, and some pipe fitters. The pipe fitters had a superintendent and an engineer, and the electricians had a superintendent and an engineer, usually. OK. And what was that called? Was it past time? Late time. Late time. And so we\u2019re here and then if the device shows up on a Monday, how long does it usually take before the event actually happens? I\u2019m just wondering. Seven to ten days. It took us about seven days to retreat, pump all the concrete, pull and close the doors. Only had one big door to close. I would say eight, nine days. About seven days to what they call button up. Final button- up would be closing all the little hatches. You had big doors that UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 56 closed the tunnel, but you had little hatches that people could crawl in and out of to get up to the end of stemming, see, in case they had to go back in and go in the line- of- sight pipe; they could actually pull the vacuum off, open up the pipe\u2014 that was costly and it usually cost them time when they did it, a day or two\u2014 and they could go in and make an adjustment and go out and then pump the pipe back down, and that usually took about, oh, twelve to fourteen hours to pump this pipe down to vacuum. Sometimes longer, according to how big the pipe was, again. Because they had big roughing pumps and then they had finishing pumps that\u2019d really get her down to however many microns they wanted to. And then once the final button- up was made, then we\u2019d retreat to control point, which was CP, into the \u201c war room,\u201d I think they called it. What was the last actual thing you did in the tunnel before you left and went to control point? Closed the hatch on the gas- sealed door, the last closure in the tunnel. What\u2019s the line- of- sight pipe doing right now? Sitting there with a vacuum on it. But I mean is it open at the other end? No, no, no, they\u2019ve got a big dome on the end of it. It\u2019s all closed. So you close that down, too. Yes, it\u2019s got a vacuum on it. See, there would be a big dome fit on the [ 00: 15: 00] end of this. Say this was the end of the pipe [ p. 24], there\u2019d be a big dome fit on there, and then a bunch of stub pipes, them little pipes would be run off of it to various experiment stations. Now at this point, is all of your attention as the mining superintendent devoted to this particular test? I mean has the next thing you\u2019re going to do come across your radar screen yet? No, we\u2019re focused on execution and reentry. OK. Are you out there\u2014? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 57 Here\u2019s your war room [ p. 27]. This is where they actually say test control center, and I would get to be back up here, more or less in just readiness. I didn\u2019t have no function other than to watch it go on. Here\u2019s your test controller. That\u2019s Larry Ashbaugh or Joe LaComb there. That looks like NORAD a little bit, or NASA [ National Aeronautics and Space Administration]. In a way, because it\u2019s all weather stations. They can tell weather, they can tell everything, they can tell you what the line- of- sight pipe is, what the temperature is at ground zero, and they have to keep ground zero at a certain temperature, so there has to be refrigeration units run right up until zero time, then they shut all power off. They can do that remote, shut all power off, and put a key in, turn it, which they\u2019ve already done that in the red shack, and then the countdown is done automatic. What\u2019s the feeling like, being in that room? Well, it just like, I think, much like a space shuttle or anything like that. Everybody\u2019s been working for sometimes three, four weeks, seven days a week. We don\u2019t shut down, you know, and it gets to where there ain\u2019t much left of you. Well, I mean a year and a half total, right, in that neighborhood, and it all boils down to this single moment? And then they can tell in a few minutes, because there\u2019ll be different places along the tunnel where they can tell if there was a radiation leak. And so is it like a mechanized countdown, you know, ten, nine, eight\u2014? Yes. Especially the last thirty seconds, OK, how was it? Let\u2019s see if I can remember how it was. It\u2019ll be, OK, \u201c time minus three minutes, T Tunnel, Distant Zenith,\u201d and then over the loudspeaker in another minute, \u201c minus two minutes, zero time, Distant Zenith,\u201d and then during UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 58 the real thing it gets down to the last\u2014 and even during the dry runs, it gets down to the last fifteen, twenty seconds, they count it down, ten, nine, eight, seven, zero time, T Tunnel, P03. I mean is it anticlimactic? Because I mean with the space shuttle, you actually get to see the space shuttle going up or\u2014 You don\u2019t see anything. If you\u2019re outside, you might get to see some dust come off the mesa. OK. Because you can\u2019t hear anything, right? No, nothing. So the first time must\u2019ve been kind of almost a letdown, somehow. Yes. Here\u2019s your radiation monitors [ p. 67], see, they\u2019re all up and down the tunnel, each one of them black spots, and this is ground zero. Here\u2019s end of stemming, right there. So if there\u2019s any leaks, all over this tunnel and clear outside the portal, out over the portal, because see our offices are over here. This is the portal. And all these are RAMS [ radiation area monitoring systems]. Mission Cyber, December 2, \u2019 88. So you know pretty much instantaneously whether or not everything is OK. The temperature, everything, yeah, they can tell within, oh, twenty seconds whether they\u2019re going to have failure. And failure means that somehow radiation gas got out from something. And they can pretty well tell where it came from. And you as a mining superintendent in the war room after twenty- one seconds after, what are you thinking now? What do you do? We get to go home. OK, so you go. And then what\u2019s the turnaround time between detonation and you going back? I was on several of them in the beginning, but once the execution goes over, the authorities hand it over to DNA, to Joe LaComb and that type, the top dogs, they call the shots from then on. So UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 59 we would have a standby group of reentry people, in case they have to go back in or go back in [ 00: 20: 00] and establish a fresh- air station at the portal. Right outside here, over here there\u2019s a big building, and that\u2019s where they establish a, OK, everything, the portal\u2019s clear, there\u2019s no radiation escape, there\u2019s no contamination, we\ufffd\ufffdre OK to go to the portal. But we can\u2019t go underground yet, but we can go to the portal. So you go up there and you assemble your reentry teams. You usually have three of them. You have a reentry team, a rescue team, and a standby team. And there are about six, seven men on each one of them. Then they can tell at all times by their RAMS or their monitors if there is any gas buildup or pressure buildup or if there\u2019s a problem, they can tell. But they physically go in there and check every foot of it and assess what they call scientific assessment. They look at the tunnel and they look at the rail and they make sure this is OK and it\u2019s all under microphone in a self- contained\u2014 like they went after them miners in Virginia, same thing. And you\u2019re out there for all this. No? Yes? OK. Yes. Usually we get to go home and shower and change clothes and get back up here by eight o\u2019clock in the morning. Say this is two o\u2019clock in the afternoon. They\u2019ll take, and I won\u2019t have any part of that, establishing a safe area at the portal. Once that\u2019s done, then we show up, usually the next morning around nine, ten o\u2019clock. Reporting time is eight. We\u2019d go up and assemble our rescue teams, and everything\u2019s pre- staged there, and then the test controller will tell us, All right, let\u2019s advance to the gas- sealed door. So we\u2019ll take a train and go as far as the first gas- sealed door is. Then they\u2019ll have a group of people under that little hatch I\u2019m talking about. And then we\u2019ll open that up. And then they\u2019ll go on through and they\u2019ll go to the next plug. They\u2019ll open up another hatch in a little turn tube and crawl through it and go up to the end of stemming on both the bypass and the LOS drift, and they\u2019re going to check for radiation, any UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 60 leaks, any gas leaks, any explosive mixtures. And once that\u2019s assessed that there\u2019s no problem, then we\u2019ll turn the ventilation on, the big ventilation outside, and that\u2019ll start ventilating the tunnel. And then usually that night we have a swing shift come on and we\u2019ve got authorization to open the big gas- sealed door. So the iron workers will go in there and open that huge door, probably weighs thirty tons, forty tons, and pull it around, and lay rail back so we can get our engines in it. And then the next day, we\u2019ll go up to the next plug, which is the overburden plug or the gas- sealed plug, not the door, the plug, and they\u2019ll go through there. A lot of the scientists go back in. If they have to recover film right away, they\u2019ll take a scientific assessment team and it\u2019ll last usually two or three hours. They won\u2019t be underground over an hour and a half. And they\u2019ll go in and get their film or something and pull it out. And then they\u2019ll let us ventilate the tunnel, continue to ventilate and continue to hook up our ventilation, and then we\u2019ll start mining back through the gas- sealed plug, which is usually drilling and blasting. Sometimes they\u2019ll let us go through these trainways with an Alpine \u2122 miner. In the early times that we had to do it, the drill and blast, but then once the Alpine \u2122 come in, then we go right down through the middle of this plug and mine out the center of it. That way, we can get our trains back in and all of our personnel. Because on a busy day you would have 200 people underground, 250, on a shift, not usually a back shift so much but on day shift you would have anywhere from the bare minimum you\u2019re going to have is about fifty or sixty, and then however many watchers and tourists that you got, people with nothing else to do that want to come watch. As far as the line- of- sight pipe, are you taking that whole thing out, or just the experiments out? Both. Sometimes they reclaimed the line- of- sight pipe up to the end of stemming, took it out, sent it to Spokane or sometimes they\u2019d do it onsite, sandblast it and clean it up and if there was [ 00: 25: 00] any radiation, you know, they\u2019ll decontaminate it, and then they\u2019ll reuse that, UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 61 especially your test chambers, because they were a lot of labor in there. The regular bare line- of- sight pipe, they can probably make that easier and cheaper than redo it. But a lot of your TAPS, they would reuse the TAPS, the tunnel and pipe seal, and that probably weighed sixty tons, eighty tons, sometimes a hundred tons, according to how big it was. Huge. Is there any reason for you guys to go back through the bypass tunnel? We do go down the bypass as far as the end of stemming, and they\u2019ll set up a diamond drill and tag ground zero. I mean a core drill, like I\u2019m saying, they\u2019ll actually core into, under special conditions, blowout preventers, you know, and full safety gear, they\u2019ll tag ground zero. I mean tag the melt or the molten rock or the area where ground zero once was. Is there any ground zero anymore? Well, it\u2019s where imaginary was. It\u2019s nothing but a big cavity, or that\u2019s usually cave\u2014 Yeah, I was going to say, is there a cavity anymore or has it been caved in? Just a chimney, yeah. In the early times, some of the events they had, the big megatons on the mesa, did leave a cavity. Benham [ 12/ 19/ 1968, U20i, 1.15 Mt] or Boxcar [ 4/ 26/ 1968, U20c, 1.3 Mt], I can\u2019t remember which one. Boxcar was the biggest, or Benham? They were the biggest megatons done on the test site. I think we only did two or three megatons. And the scientists said that there was a cavity there that you could put Boulder Dam in. That\u2019s 7,000 feet. Big as Boulder Dam. A cavity of 7,000 feet, as big as Boulder Dam? Yes. And then it would cave in, every once in a while you\u2019d hear\u2014 you\u2019d be down\u2014 I was underground at 19G and you could feel that. It wouldn\u2019t be a rocking, swaying motion. You\u2019d feel the energy, I guess, through the tunnel wall because Benham was only about five miles UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 62 away, but there\u2019d be huge cave- ins inside that cavity for a long time, for two or three months. Every once in a while, we\u2019d feel that cave- in. You can\u2019t hear\u2014 From five miles away, you would feel it? Yes. Underground. Yes. Because it had to be huge. I mean you got to have boulders flying around there, or falling. Not flying but falling. You know, as big as Boulder Dam, that\u2019s huge. And then, you know, it stayed a cavity, an open cavity, pretty much for quite a while, three or four months. And then every once in a while we\u2014 because we couldn\u2019t figure out what it was. So finally one of the bosses, they said, Hey, we\u2019re going to shut this thing down, and finally got some of the scientists and they started coordinating their geophones with the time it would happen and said, well, yeah, that\u2019s all that is, is whatever the codename was, Benham or Boxcar. But it was in the megaton range. A million tons of TNT. Most of them we did in the tunnels were kilotons. Fifteen, twenty kilotons. We have three- and- a- half minutes. We can always put another CD in, but is there anything you feel like I should know about the post- detonation? It\u2019s still the same mining for us except we went much slower and you usually had the scientists right there. When you got close to one of their experiments, oh, they\u2019d be right there, well, we got to mine just a little slow and do a lot of it by hand with spaders and chippers until they got one of their gauges out and they\u2019d let us go again. But we\u2019d reenter down and they inspected every foot of it. How long between the time you actually start the reentry process and the time where it\u2019s done, complete, you\u2019re ready to move on to the next task? Three or four months. That long? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 63 Yes. By the time you get all the mining done, back, because we had to mine back in usually to the GSAC and MAC to check them out, and they\u2019d pull them out and reuse them. So we went back within, oh, 300 feet, 400 feet of ground zero, with our mining. Usually down the same old drift. We just mined the old concrete out. Because they wanted to see how, again, if we did a good job of filling the tunnel. Because one time we didn\u2019t. It was at P Tunnel. I got my ___ chewed on a little bit. They said, hey! Oh, and I saw it. I says, oh, shit. Because I\u2019d seen it first. I [ 00: 30: 00] said, oh, my God. What they call a top- off hole. Say this was the tunnel here [ drawing] and every so often we\u2019d have to drill a hole up in here, up in the back or the roof, oh, that big around [ indicating size] and then stick a four- inch pipe in there. And then we\u2019d pump on that last. That was the bleed to let the air off. And when this tunnel got plumb full of concrete, it would force it up in here and out this little pipe, because there would be a pipe in there, and then it\u2019d be run clear out to the bulkhead, see. So this is a top- off number 2. Top- off number 2. When that got full of concrete, you knew that the drift was full of concrete. But not always. It didn\u2019t always run that way. See, there would be voids in it, and just sometimes the concrete would be up in there but yet this little bit would be void, see. You couldn\u2019t have that. No voids whatsoever. Because, see, once it\u2014 exponential numbers that went on, once that gas got into this, see, it could create more and more and more. Then it could get away from you. So we had to make sure everything was gas- sealed tight. Labor intensive. Hours and hours. Yes, it sounds like it. Well, we literally have fifty seconds left. Sum up a test in fifty seconds. Yes, that\u2019s it, sum up a test. Get ready for the next one. That\u2019s what we did. Yeah. Would you get any time off or would it be basically done with this one, all right\u2014? UNLV Nevada Test Site Oral History Project 64 Some. Well, yeah, the heat would be off once the reentry was established and we got back to the everyday way of doing business, mining the bypass and stuff like that, yeah, we\u2019d get time off. It wasn\u2019t bad. But you didn\u2019t ask for none of that until after zero time. We\u2019re at T- minus- 10, so [ laughing]. OK. All right, that\u2019s good. Thanks, John.
