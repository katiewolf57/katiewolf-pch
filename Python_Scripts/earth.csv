Coronal mass ejections are different from solar flares, though sometimes they happen at the same time. While solar flares are made u only of light and energetic articles (like protons and electrons), coronal mass ejections are clouds of gaseous solar material and magnetic fields. Both coronal mass ejections and flares tend to come from regions on the sun that are very magnetically active (meaning that the magnetic fields shift and change a lot in those areas). To get an idea of how huge coronal mass ejections can be: that white circle is outlining the sun. A million Earths could fit inside the sun, so imagine how many could fit in that one cloud of gas! Coronal mass ejections can travel in all directions, but images like this can help scientists figure out if they're headed toward Earth. When a coronal mass ejection reaches Earth, it can cause raid changes in the magnetic environment around our planet - which is called a geomagnetic storm.""]"
