Spacecraft now allow us the luxury to study these cosmic crossings at times of our choosing from unique locales across our solar system.This poster is from a set of new &quot;travel posters&quot; from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, which envision a day when the creativity of scientists and engineers will allow us to do things we can only dream of now. The posters in the set depict various cosmic destinations including Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, Saturn's vapor-spewing moon Enceladus, and the dwarf planet Ceres. You can take a virtual trip to 14 alien worlds, and maybe even plaster your living room with planetary art, via the new, futuristic space tourism posters. The posters are the brainchild of The Studio at JPL, a design and strategy team that works with JPL scientists and engineers to visualize and depict complex science and technology topics. Their work is used in designing space missions and in sharing the work of NASA/JPL with the public.

It was also the first probe to visit two planets. Launched on November 3, 1973, it reached Venus on February 5, 1974. Using a gravity assist from this planet, Mariner 10 first crossed the orbit of Mercury on March 29, 1974 and did so a second time on September 21, 1974. A third and last Mercury encounter took place on March 16, 1975. It measured the environments of both Venus and Mercury. It then undertook experiments in the interplanetary medium. Mariner 10 showed that Venus had at best a weak magnetic field, and its ionosphere interacted with the solar wind to form a bow shock. At Mercury, it confirmed that Mercury had no atmosphere and a cratered, dormant Moon-like surface.",

                    "Mariner 10 was the seventh successful launch in the Mariner series and the first spacecraft to use the gravitational pull of one planet (Venus) to reach another (Mercury). It was also the first probe to visit two planets. Launched on November 3, 1973, it reached Venus on February 5, 1974. Using a gravity assist from this planet, Mariner 10 first crossed the orbit of Mercury on March 29, 1974 and did so a second time on September 21, 1974. A third and last Mercury encounter took place on March 16, 1975. It measured the environments of both Venus and Mercury. It then undertook experiments in the interplanetary medium. Mariner 10 showed that Venus had at best a weak magnetic field, and its ionosphere interacted with the solar wind to form a bow shock. At Mercury, it confirmed that Mercury had no atmosphere and a cratered, dormant Moon-like surface.",

Today, powerful observatories like NASA's Kepler space telescope, will continue the hunt of distant planets. This poster is from a set of new &quot;travel posters&quot; from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, which envision a day when the creativity of scientists and engineers will allow us to do things we can only dream of now. The posters in the set depict various cosmic destinations including Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, Saturn's vapor-spewing moon Enceladus, and the dwarf planet Ceres. You can take a virtual trip to 14 alien worlds, and maybe even plaster your living room with planetary art, via the new, futuristic space tourism posters. The posters are the brainchild of The Studio at JPL, a design and strategy team that works with JPL scientists and engineers to visualize and depict complex science and technology topics. Their work is used in designing space missions and in sharing the work of NASA/JPL with the public. The Archive copy is a high resolution TIFF image that can be downloaded from the digital library and printed 20 x 30 inches in high-resolution.\n        </description>\n        <subject>Space tourism</subject>\n        <subject>Interplanetary voyages</subject>\n        <subject>Space travelers</subject>\n        <subject>Extrasolar planets</subject>\n        <subject>51 Pegasi b (Planet)</subject>\n        <subject>Exploration of 51 Pegasi b (Planet)</subject>\n        <subject>Planets--Exploration</subject>\n        <subject>Recreation and tourism</subject>\n        <subject>Industry and technology</subject>\n        <sourceid>digcoll_usl_22</sourceid>\n        <recordid>digcoll_usl_22library2_lib/81572</recordid>\n        <creationdate>2016</creationdate>\n        <addtitle>Is part of: U.S. Federal Publications</addtitle>\n        <addtitle>Has part: NASA Visions of the Future</addtitle>\n        <addtitle>\n          Visions of the future posters; Exotic cosmic locales available as space tourism posters; Exoplanet travel bureau posters\n        </addtitle>\n        <addsrcrecordid>usl-22-120-1559</addsrcrecordid>\n        <scope>mw</scope>\n        <lsr01>usl</lsr01>\n        <lsr02>22</lsr02>\n        <lsr03>120</lsr03>\n        <lsr04>1559</lsr04>\n        <lsr09>Utah State Library</lsr09>\n        <lsr10>Utah Government Publications Online Digital Library</lsr10>\n        <lsr12>Utah State Library</lsr12>\n        <lsr13>Utah Government Digital Library</lsr13>\n        <lsr14>51 Pegasi b (Planet)</lsr14>\n        <lsr15>U.S. Federal Publications</lsr15>\n        <rsrctype>images</rsrctype>\n      </search>\n      <sort>\n        <title>51 Pegasi b : greetings from your first exoplanet [poster]</title>\n        <creationdate>2016</creationdate>\n      </sort>\n      <facets>\n        <language>eng</language>\n        <creationdate>2016</creationdate>\n        <topic>Space tourism</topic>\n        <topic>Interplanetary voyages</topic>\n        <topic>Space travelers</topic>\n        <topic>Extrasolar planets</topic>\n        <topic>51 Pegasi b (Planet)</topic>\n        <topic>Exploration of 51 Pegasi b (Planet)</topic>\n        <topic>Planets--Exploration</topic>\n        <topic>Recreation and tourism</topic>\n        <topic>Industry and technology</topic>\n        <collection>Digital Collections</collection>\n        <toplevel>online_resources</toplevel>\n        <format>application/pdf</format>\n        <genre>unknown</genre>\n        <lfc01>Utah Government Digital Library</lfc01>\n        <lfc02>Utah State Library</lfc02>\n        <lfc03>Utah State Library</lfc03>\n        <lfc04>Utah Government Publications Online Digital Library</lfc04>\n        <lfc08>51 Pegasi b (Planet)</lfc08>\n        <prefilter>images</prefilter>\n        <rsrctype>images</rsrctype>\n        <newrecords>20170208_784</newrecords>\n        <frbrgroupid>325379629</frbrgroupid>\n        <frbrtype>6</frbrtype>\n      </facets>\n      <delivery>\n        <institution>MWDL</institution>\n        <delcategory>Online Resource</delcategory>\n      </delivery>\n      <ranking>\n        <booster1>1</booster1>\n        <booster2>1</booster2>\n      </ranking>\n      <addata>\n        <date>2016</date>\n        <pub>Jet Propulsion Laboratory (U.S.)</pub>\n      </addata>\n    </record>\n  </PrimoNMBib>\n  <sear:GETIT \n  deliveryCategory=\"Online Resource\" GetIt1=\"http://digitallibrary.utah.gov/awweb/guest.jsp?smd=1&amp;cl=all_lib&amp;lb_document_id=81572\" GetIt2=\"http://1.1.1.1?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&amp;ctx_tim=2018-12-03T13%3A34%3A33IST&amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;url_ctx_fmt=infofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/primo.exlibrisgroup.com:primo3-Journal-digcoll_usl_22&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:&amp;rft.genre=&amp;rft.atitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.aulast=&amp;rft.auinit=&amp;rft.auinit1=&amp;rft.series=&amp;rft.auinitm=&amp;rft.ausuffix=&amp;rft.au=&amp;rft.aucorp=&amp;rft.volume=&amp;rft.issue=&amp;rft.part=&amp;rft.quarter=&amp;rft.ssn=&amp;rft.spage=&amp;rft.epage=&amp;rft.pages=&amp;rft.artnum=&amp;rft.issn=&amp;rft.eissn=&amp;rft.isbn=&amp;rft.sici=&amp;rft.coden=&amp;rft_id=info:doi/&amp;rft.object_id=&amp;rft.eisbn=&amp;rft_dat=%3Cdigcoll_usl_22%3Elibrary2_lib/81572%3C/digcoll_usl_22%3E%3Cgrp_id%3E325379629%3C/grp_id%3E%3Coa%3E%3C/oa%3E&amp;rft_id=info:oai/&amp;req.language=&amp;rft_pqid=\">\n</sear:GETIT>\n  <sear:LINKS>\n    <sear:linktorsrc>\n      http://digitallibrary.utah.gov/awweb/guest.jsp?smd=1&amp;cl=all_lib&amp;lb_document_id=81572\n    </sear:linktorsrc>\n    <sear:thumbnail>\n      http://digitallibrary.utah.gov/awweb/pdfopener?did=81572&amp;fp=auto\n    </sear:thumbnail>\n    <sear:thumbnail>\n      http://digitallibrary.utah.gov/awweb/pdfopener?did=81572&amp;fp=auto\n    </sear:thumbnail>\n  </sear:LINKS>\n</sear:DOC>\n"

This poster is from a set of new \"travel posters\" from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, which envision a day when the creativity of scientists and engineers will allow us to do things we can only dream of now. The posters in the set depict various cosmic destinations including Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa,"
