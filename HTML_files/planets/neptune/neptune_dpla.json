Today both Voyager spacecraft continue to return valuable science from the far reaches of our solar system. This poster is from a set of new &quot;travel posters&quot; from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, which envision a day when the creativity of scientists and engineers will allow us to do things we can only dream of now. The posters in the set depict various cosmic destinations including Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, Saturn's vapor-spewing moon Enceladus, and the dwarf planet Ceres. You can take a virtual trip to 14 alien worlds, and maybe even plaster your living room with planetary art, via the new, futuristic space tourism posters. The posters are the brainchild of The Studio at JPL, a design and strategy team that works with JPL scientists and engineers to visualize and depict complex science and technology topics. Their work is used in designing space missions and in sharing the work of NASA/JPL with the public. The Archive copy is a high resolution TIFF image that can be downloaded from the digital library and printed 20 x 30 inches in high-resolution.\n        </description>\n        <subject>Space tourism</subject>\n        <subject>Outer planets</subject>\n        <subject>Exploration of Jupiter (Planet)</subject>\n        <subject>Exploration of Uranus (Planet)</subject>\n        <subject>Exploration of Saturn (Planet)</subject>\n        <subject>Interplanetary voyages</subject>\n        <subject>Space travelers</subject>\n        <subject>Jupiter (Planet)</subject>\n        <subject>Neptune (Planet)</subject>\n        <subject>Saturn (Planet)</subject>\n        <subject>Exploration of Neptune (Planet)</subject>\n        <subject>Uranus (Planet)</subject>\n        <subject>Planets--Exploration</subject>\n        <subject>Recreation and tourism</subject>\n        <subject>Industry and technology</subject>\n        <sourceid>digcoll_usl_22</sourceid>\n        <recordid>digcoll_usl_22library2_lib/81565</recordid>\n        <creationdate>2016</creationdate>\n        <addtitle>Is part of: U.S. Federal Publications</addtitle>\n        <addtitle>Has part: NASA Visions of the Future</addtitle>\n        <addtitle>\n          Visions of the future posters;

                    "NASA\u2019s Voyager mission took advantage of a once-every-175-year alignment of the outer planets for a grand tour of the solar system. The twin spacecraft revealed stunning details about Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - using each planet\u2019s gravity to send them on to the next destination. Voyager set the stage for such ambitious orbiter missions as Galileo to Jupiter and Cassini to Saturn. Today both Voyager spacecraft continue to return valuable science from the far reaches of our solar system. This poster is from a set of new \"travel posters\" from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, which envision a day when the creativity of scientists and engineers will allow us to do things we can only dream of now. The posters in the set depict various cosmic destinations including Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, Saturn's vapor-spewing moon Enceladus, and the dwarf planet Ceres. You can take a virtual trip to 14 alien worlds, and maybe even plaster your living room wi"

The posters in the set depict various cosmic destinations including Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, Saturn's vapor-spewing moon Enceladus, and the dwarf planet Ceres. You can take a virtual trip to 14 alien worlds, and maybe even plaster your living room with planetary art, via the new, futuristic space tourism posters. The posters are the brainchild of The Studio at JPL, a design and strategy team that works with JPL scientists and engineers to visualize and depict complex science and technology topics. Their work is used in designing space missions and in sharing the work of NASA/JPL with the public.

The illustration is a photograph of a man and woman standing in front of a movie marquee at Cinema Viejo movie theater. The man is straddling the driver's seat of a tandem bicycle and looking at the woman who is standing next to him and has her arm propped on his shoulder while looking at a sheet of paper that she's holding. The marquee reads, \\\"Ben Gazzara, Ernest Borgnine, Neptune Factor, PG, Battle for the Planet of the Apes.\\\" There is also a thumbnail map in the lower right corner of the advertisement that shows the location of Mission Viejo with respect to local freeways and coastal cities as well as the location of the mentioned housing developments within Mission Viejo. The text of the advertisement reads, \\\"Ride your bike to Saturday night. Mission Viejo, where \\\"home\\\" is a \\\"hometown\\\" again. Bet you haven't done that in years ... a warm spring evening, the kids staying with some friends, nice night to take in a movie. Even better when you don't have to fight traffic, pay for parking , then walk six bloxcks. When we planned Mission Viejo, we had a feeling people liked things \\\"kind of close by\\\", so that a bike would put you right in the heart of town. A little old fashioned, maybe, but we liked the idea. And we were right. Because now it costs more in gas to get there than it does to get in the theater ... and you miss all that nice fresh air. (Mission Viejo is nestled in the gentle ountains of Orange County ... the air really is fresh). And besides the theater, we have thoses fabulous recreation centers, parks, schools, shopping plazas, and a $5 million hospital. It's all part of our town, Mission Viejo. And it's all yours when you live here ... Aliso Villas Townhomes from $24,495, New Madrid from $43,750, New Barcelona from $30,950, The Casta del Sol Active Retirement Neighborhood from $30,995, Castille from $34,200.

                    "Black and white photograph of an advertisement for the city of Mission Viejo and its residential housing developments. The illustration is a photograph of a man and woman standing in front of a movie marquee at Cinema Viejo movie theater. The man is straddling the driver's seat of a tandem bicycle and looking at the woman who is standing next to him and has her arm propped on his shoulder while looking at a sheet of paper that she's holding. The marquee reads, \"Ben Gazzara, Ernest Borgnine, Neptune Factor, PG, Battle for the Planet of the Apes.\" There is also a thumbnail map in the lower right corner of the advertisement that shows the location of Mission Viejo with respect to local freeways and coastal cities as well as the location of the mentioned housing developments within Mission Viejo. The text of the advertisement reads, \"Ride your bike to Saturday night. Mission Viejo, where \"home\" is a \"hometown\" again. Bet you haven't done that in years ... a warm spring evening, the kids staying with some friends, nice night to take in a movie. Even better when you don't have to fight traffic, pay for parking , then walk six bloxcks. When we planned Mission Viejo, we had a feeling people liked things \"kind of close by\", so that a bike would put you right in the heart of town. A little old fashioned, maybe, but we liked the idea. And we were right. Because now it costs more in gas to get there than it does to get in the theater ... and you miss all that nice fresh air. (Mission Viejo is nestled in the gentle ountains of Orange County ... the air really is fresh). And besides the theater, we have thoses fabulous recreation centers, parks, schools, shopping plazas, and a $5 million hospital. It's all part of our town, Mission Viejo. And it's all yours when you live here ...
