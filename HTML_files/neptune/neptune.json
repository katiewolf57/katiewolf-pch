The illustration is a photograph of a man and woman standing in front of a movie marquee at Cinema Viejo movie theater. The man is straddling the driver's seat of a tandem bicycle and looking at the woman who is standing next to him and has her arm propped on his shoulder while looking at a sheet of paper that she's holding. The marquee reads, \\\"Ben Gazzara, Ernest Borgnine, Neptune Factor, PG, Battle for the Planet of the Apes.\\\" There is also a thumbnail map in the lower right corner of the advertisement that shows the location of Mission Viejo with respect to local freeways and coastal cities as well as the location of the mentioned housing developments within Mission Viejo. The text of the advertisement reads, \\\"Ride your bike to Saturday night. Mission Viejo, where \\\"home\\\" is a \\\"hometown\\\" again. Bet you haven't done that in years ... a warm spring evening, the kids staying with some friends, nice night to take in a movie. Even better when you don't have to fight traffic, pay for parking , then walk six bloxcks. When we planned Mission Viejo, we had a feeling people liked things \\\"kind of close by\\\", so that a bike would put you right in the heart of town. A little old fashioned, maybe, but we liked the idea. And we were right. Because now it costs more in gas to get there than it does to get in the theater ... and you miss all that nice fresh air. (Mission Viejo is nestled in the gentle ountains of Orange County ... the air really is fresh). And besides the theater, we have thoses fabulous recreation centers, parks, schools, shopping plazas, and a $5 million hospital. It's all part of our town, Mission Viejo.

                    "Black and white photograph of an advertisement for the city of Mission Viejo and its residential housing developments. The illustration is a photograph of a man and woman standing in front of a movie marquee at Cinema Viejo movie theater. The man is straddling the driver's seat of a tandem bicycle and looking at the woman who is standing next to him and has her arm propped on his shoulder while looking at a sheet of paper that she's holding. The marquee reads, \"Ben Gazzara, Ernest Borgnine, Neptune Factor, PG, Battle for the Planet of the Apes.\" There is also a thumbnail map in the lower right corner of the advertisement that shows the location of Mission Viejo with respect to local freeways and coastal cities as well as the location of the mentioned housing developments within Mission Viejo. The text of the advertisement reads, \"Ride your bike to Saturday night. Mission Viejo, where \"home\" is a \"hometown\" again. Bet you haven't done that in years ... a warm spring evening, the kids staying with some friends, nice night to take in a movie. Even better when you don't have to fight traffic, pay for parking , then walk six bloxcks. When we planned Mission Viejo, we had a feeling people liked things \"kind of close by\", so that a bike would put you right in the heart of town. A little old fashioned, maybe, but we liked the idea. And we were right. Because now it costs more in gas to get there than it does to get in the theater ... and you miss all that nice fresh air. (Mission Viejo is nestled in the gentle ountains of Orange County ... the air really is fresh). And besides the theater, we have thoses fabulous recreation centers, parks, schools, shopping plazas, and a $5 million hospital. It's all part of our town, Mission Viejo. And it's all yours when you live here ...
