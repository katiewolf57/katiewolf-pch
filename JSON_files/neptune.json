                    "This map of the solar system from 1849 may look a little different from what you\u0092re used to! The planets Neptune and Uranus were still called Le Verrier and Hershel, and Pluto hadn\u0092t even been discovered as the 9th planet or reclassified as a dwarf planet yet! Though some things have changed since this map was made, the planets are still as far away today as they were then. To measure these distances, scientists use a unit of measurement called a light-year, which is the distance that light travels in one year that equals 9.4607 x 10^12 kilometers or nearly 6 trillion miles! The other planets and the sun are much closer to Earth. The sun is only .000158 light-years away, and Pluto is only .000793 light-years away. Currently, most of the possibly habitable planets outside the solar system that scientists have discovered are up to 300 million light-years away. Although some, like planet Kepler 22-b, are even further out at 600 light-years or 3 and a half quadrillion miles from Earth!"

The planets Neptune and Uranus were still called Le Verrier and Hershel, and Pluto hadn\u0092t even been discovered as the 9th planet or reclassified as a dwarf planet yet! Though some things have changed since this map was made, the planets are still as far away today as they were then. To measure these distances, scientists use a unit of measurement called a light-year, which is the distance that light travels in one year that equals 9.4607 x 10^12 kilometers or nearly 6 trillion miles! The other planets and the sun are much closer to Earth. The sun is only .000158 light-years away, and Pluto is only .000793 light-years away. Currently, most of the possibly habitable planets outside the solar system that scientists have discovered are up to 300 million light-years away. Although some, like planet Kepler 22-b, are even further out at 600 light-years or 3 and a half quadrillion miles from Earth!",

The ancient Greeks used the word \u0093planet\u0094, which means wanderer, to describe the huge objects they saw in the sky because they appear to move while the stars in the background appear to stand still. While now we know that everything is moving, including the stars, the name \u0093planet\u0094 stuck with us. According to how scientists define the term, there are eight planets in oursolar system, meaning, objects that orbitthe Sun. The sun uses gravity to keep the planets spinning in orbit, and it also provides heat and light to each of them. The four inner planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Composed of mostly rock and metal and with solid surfaces, these are given the term \u0093terrestiral\u0094 or Earth-like. The four outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are all much larger than the inner planets; Jupiter is larger than the seven other planets combined! In addition to their size, they also differ from the inner planets in that they have no solid surfaces; they are made of liquid and gases, and they each have a ring system and several moons.

                    "This artifact is a Development Test Model (DTM) for the Voyager spacecraft that consists of facsimile and dummy parts manufactured by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It was acquired by NASM in 1977 and placed on display in the Exploring the Planets gallery shortly thereafter. In 1987, JPL removed the DTM bus for use in developing the Magellan Venus spacecraft, which was similar in design, and replaced it with a facsimile.",
                    "The Voyager program was conceived in the mid-1960's as a mission to explore the outer planets using Mariner-style spacecraft. Officially, the original objective to investigate all of the outer planets in a \"grand tour\" was scaled back to Jupiter and Saturn exclusively due to budgetary cut-backs. However, Voyager 2 was launched on August 20, 1977 and placed on a slow flight path to Jupiter. Subsequently, Voyager 1 was launched on September 5, 1977 and arrived at Jupiter first in March 1979 and Saturn in November 1980. Because Saturn's moon, Titan, is the only other planet with a predominately nitrogen atmosphere, Voyager 1's trajectory was designed to pass within 2550 miles. This manuever caused the flight path to leave the ecliptic plane and out of the Solar System. Voyager 2 encounter Jupiter in July 1979 and Saturn in August 1981. Its slower flight path was designed to allow it to go on to Uranus in January 1986 and then to Neptune in August 1989 as the funding became available to continue the mission.",
                    "The Voyager TV cameras, ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers, and photopolarimeter are mounted on a scan platform that is stabilized about two axes of rotation. These instruments can be pointed with and accuracy of better than one-tenth of a degree. Because the spacecraft travel at speeds in excess of 35,000 mph, and the light levels at Neptune can be 900 times fainter than those on Earth, the spacecraft angular rates were programmed to extremely small to prevent smearing.",
                    "Voyager was the little spacecraft that could.\"-Edward Stone, Voyager Chief Scientist, Jet Propulsion Laboratory",
                    "Voyager",
                    "In the 1970s, NASA's leadership conceived their most daring planetary science expedition, Voyager. It took advantage of a rare astronomical event. Once every 176 years, the giant planets on the outer reaches of the solar system all gather on one side of the sun, and such a configuration was due to occur in the late 1970s. This geometric lineup made possible in a single flight close-up observation of all the planets in the outer solar system (with the exception of Pluto), the \"Grand Tour.\" This planetary alignment offered a crucial advantage: As the spacecraft passed each planet, gravity would bend its flight path and increase its velocity enough to deliver it to the next destination. Known as \"gravity assist,\" this complex process gave the spacecraft a \"slingshot\" boost at each planet. Neptune, the outermost planet in the mission, thus could be reached in 12 rather than 30 years.",
                    "In 1964 NASA conceived Pioneer 10 and 11, the first probes to explore the solar system beyond Mars, and these became the precursors of the Grand Tour of Voyager. Severe budgetary constraints hampered the projects, delaying their launch until 1972 and 1973, respectively Pioneer 10 and 11 yielded invaluable science, Designed to last for 30 months, they performed for more than 20 years, returning useful data on Jupiter and Saturn, as well as providing our first look beyond the solar system at interstellar space.",
                    "Voyager stood as a greater challenge. A four-planet \"grand tour\" was theoretically possible. But design was crucial. A single spacecraft might accomplish the mission, but would have to be extraordinarily complex and expensive to travel to the outer reaches of the solar system, endure for more than a decade, and reliably operate a range of scientific instruments. To simplify the mission and limit the expense, the mission relied on two Voyager spacecraft to conduct intensive flyby studies only of Jupiter and Saturn-in effect repeating on a more elaborate scale the flights of the two Pioneers. With an $865 million budget, engineers designed the two Voyagers to conduct as much science and to last as long as possible. Launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Voyager 2 lifted off on August 20, 1977 and Voyager 1 on September 5, 1977, each taking different trajectories to the outer planets.",
                    "By December 1980, the two Voyager spacecraft had accomplished successfully their objectives at Jupiter and Saturn. Flybys of the two outermost giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, proved possible-and irresistible-to mission scientists.

However, Voyager 2 was launched on August 20, 1977 and placed on a slow flight path to Jupiter. Subsequently, Voyager 1 was launched on September 5, 1977 and arrived at Jupiter first in March 1979 and Saturn in November 1980. Because Saturn's moon, Titan, is the only other planet with a predominately nitrogen atmosphere, Voyager 1's trajectory was designed to pass within 2550 miles. This manuever caused the flight path to leave the ecliptic plane and out of the Solar System. Voyager 2 encounter Jupiter in July 1979 and Saturn in August 1981. Its slower flight path was designed to allow it to go on to Uranus in January 1986 and then to Neptune in August 1989 as the funding became available to continue the mission.",

Once every 176 years, the giant planets on the outer reaches of the solar system all gather on one side of the sun, and such a configuration was due to occur in the late 1970s. This geometric lineup made possible in a single flight close-up observation of all the planets in the outer solar system (with the exception of Pluto), the \"Grand Tour.\" This planetary alignment offered a crucial advantage: As the spacecraft passed each planet, gravity would bend its flight path and increase its velocity enough to deliver it to the next destination. Known as \"gravity assist,\" this complex process gave the spacecraft a \"slingshot\" boost at each planet. Neptune, the outermost planet in the mission, thus could be reached in 12 rather than 30 years.",

To simplify the mission and limit the expense, the mission relied on two Voyager spacecraft to conduct intensive flyby studies only of Jupiter and Saturn-in effect repeating on a more elaborate scale the flights of the two Pioneers. With an $865 million budget, engineers designed the two Voyagers to conduct as much science and to last as long as possible.

This poster is from a set of new \"travel posters\" from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, which envision a day when the creativity of scientists and engineers will allow us to do things we can only dream of now.

                    "This series (of 38 programs) presents Dr. Edwin Boring's famous psychology course which he teaches at Harvard. He gives the basic facts and principles necessary to uncover man's awareness, thought and behavior. Stress will be placed on the biological development of these phenomena and the role of heredity and learning in determining human abilities and human efficiency. The topics of this episode are determinism and man's freedom. Science and religion are discussed. Dr. Boring mentions that the Soviet Union followed the philosophy of dialectic materialism, which determined its economic plan. This did not work for all, and voluntarism was implemented instead. He mentioned a book on contribution of catholic church into scientific psychology Roman Catholic Psychology, which shows no conflict between observation and revelation. Necessity of freedom is discussed. Dr. Boring points out that Freud came into scene with the dynamic personality, but novelists discovered that deterministic personality does not always work for novels and fictional characters, because literature needs freedom. He brings up the history of science and how things happened at particular times, because they fitted with culture and thought at the time. Hence simultaneous scientific discoveries could happen, i.e. the discovery of planet Neptune. Dr. Boring shows the chart of black dots representing events and discoveries and explains that models don't have to be truthful to be useful. He talks about tolerance and how people need to understand rather than blame. According to Dr. Boring, freedom means responsibility. He offers an ethical model: keep responsibility for yourself and try to lift it from another and try to understand his/her causes. If you both fail, then you are both in determinism. Dr. Boring concludes the last episode with the words of hope that the Psychology One program will give his audience the attitude of tolerance to understand other human beings rather than blaming them. Summary and select metadata for this record was submitted by The Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute."

He gives the basic facts and principles necessary to uncover man's awareness, thought and behavior. Stress will be placed on the biological development of these phenomena and the role of heredity and learning in determining human abilities and human efficiency. The topics of this episode are determinism and man's freedom. Science and religion are discussed. Dr. Boring mentions that the Soviet Union followed the philosophy of dialectic materialism, which determined its economic plan. This did not work for all, and voluntarism was implemented instead. He mentioned a book on contribution of catholic church into scientific psychology Roman Catholic Psychology, which shows no conflict between observation and revelation. Necessity of freedom is discussed. Dr. Boring points out that Freud came into scene with the dynamic personality, but novelists discovered that deterministic personality does not always work for novels and fictional characters, because literature needs freedom. He brings up the history of science and how things happened at particular times, because they fitted with culture and thought at the time. Hence simultaneous scientific discoveries could happen, i.e. the discovery of planet Neptune. Dr. Boring shows the chart of black dots representing events and discoveries and explains that models don't have to be truthful to be useful. He talks about tolerance and how people need to understand rather than blame. According to Dr. Boring, freedom means responsibility. He offers an ethical model: keep responsibility for yourself and try to lift it from another and try to understand his/her causes. If you both fail, then you are both in determinism. Dr. Boring concludes the last episode with the words of hope that the Psychology One program will give his audience the attitude of tolerance to understand other human beings rather than blaming them.

                    "For over 30 years, the Pioneer 10 spacecraft sent photographs and scientific information back to Earth. Launched March 2, 1972, it reached speeds of 52,100 kilometers (32,400 miles) per hour on its flight to Jupiter, making it one of the fastest human-made objects ever. After completing an investigation of Jupiter, Pioneer 10 continued on to the outer regions of the solar system, studying solar wind and cosmic rays.",
                    "Having gone further into space than any other object sent from Earth, Pioneer's last weak signal was received on January 22, 2003, from approximately 12.2 billion kilometers (7.6 billion miles) from Earth. NASA engineers reported that Pioneer 10's radioisotope power source had degraded and was not likely to allow future transmissions.",
                    "As it drifts into interstellar space, Pioneer 10 will continue to carry a plaque designed to inform intelligent life that may find it about the spacecraft and its origins. The prototype spacecraft displayed here was constructed for NASA by TRW, Inc.",
                    "During the latter 1960s, G.A. Flandro, a JPL scientist, discovered that once every 176 years both the Earth and all the giant planets of the Solar System gather on one side of the Sun. This geometric line-up made possible close\u2011up observation of all the planets in the outer solar system (with the exception of Pluto) in a single flight, the \"Grand Tour.\" The flyby of each planet would bend the spacecraft's flight path and increase its velocity enough to deliver it to the next destination. This would occur through a complicated process known as \"gravity assist,\" something like a slingshot effect, whereby the flight time to Neptune could be reduced from 30 to 12 years. Such a configuration was due to occur in the late 1970s, and it led to one of the most significant space probe efforts undertaken by the U.S.",
                    "To prepare the way for the \"Grand Tour,\" NASA conceived Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 as outer solar system probes. Both were small, nuclear\u2011powered, spin\u2011stabilized spacecraft that Atlas\u2011Centaur launched. The first of these was launched on 3 March 1972, and encountered Jupiter in early December 1973. On 22 January 2003, when Pioneer 10\u2019s signal was last detected, the spacecraft had travelled 82 AU (7.6 billion miles) from Earth, more than twice the distance from the Sun to Pluto. In 1973, NASA launched Pioneer 11, providing scientists with their closest view of Jupiter, from 26,600 miles above the cloud tops in December 1974. The close approach accelerated the spacecraft's speed to 107,373 mph, by far the fastest ever reached by a an object from Earth, and hurled Pioneer 11 1.5\u2011billion miles across the Solar System toward Saturn.",

                    "First Spacecraft to Travel Beyond Asteroid Belt, Fly By Jupiter and Saturn",
                    "The first probes to cross the solar system\u2019s outer reaches, Pioneer 10 and 11 excited people about deep space exploration.",
                    "The Pioneer spacecraft, launched in 1972 and 1973, were the first to traverse the asteroid belt and explore the region around the giant planet Jupiter. Pioneer 11 also explored Saturn. The two craft are headed out of the solar system toward other stars in the galaxy."

This geometric line-up made possible close\u2011up observation of all the planets in the outer solar system (with the exception of Pluto) in a single flight, the \"Grand Tour.\" The flyby of each planet would bend the spacecraft's flight path and increase its velocity enough to deliver it to the next destination. This would occur through a complicated process known as \"gravity assist,\" something like a slingshot effect, whereby the flight time to Neptune could be reduced from 30 to 12 years. Such a configuration was due to occur in the late 1970s, and it led to one of the most significant space probe efforts undertaken by the U.S.",

The first of these was launched on 3 March 1972, and encountered Jupiter in early December 1973. On 22 January 2003, when Pioneer 10\u2019s signal was last detected, the spacecraft had travelled 82 AU (7.6 billion miles) from Earth, more than twice the distance from the Sun to Pluto. In 1973, NASA launched Pioneer 11, providing scientists with their closest view of Jupiter, from 26,600 miles above the cloud tops in December 1974. The close approach accelerated the spacecraft's speed to 107,373 mph, by far the fastest ever reached by a an object from Earth, and hurled Pioneer 11 1.5\u2011billion miles across the Solar System toward Saturn.",

The illustration is a photograph of a man and woman standing in front of a movie marquee at Cinema Viejo movie theater. The man is straddling the driver's seat of a tandem bicycle and looking at the woman who is standing next to him and has her arm propped on his shoulder while looking at a sheet of paper that she's holding. The marquee reads, \\\"Ben Gazzara, Ernest Borgnine, Neptune Factor, PG, Battle for the Planet of the Apes.\\\" There is also a thumbnail map in the lower right corner of the advertisement that shows the location of Mission Viejo with respect to local freeways and coastal cities as well as the location of the mentioned housing developments within Mission Viejo. The text of the advertisement reads, \\\"Ride your bike to Saturday night. Mission Viejo, where \\\"home\\\" is a \\\"hometown\\\" again. Bet you haven't done that in years ... a warm spring evening, the kids staying with some friends, nice night to take in a movie. Even better when you don't have to fight traffic, pay for parking , then walk six bloxcks. When we planned Mission Viejo, we had a feeling people liked things \\\"kind of close by\\\", so that a bike would put you right in the heart of town. A little old fashioned, maybe, but we liked the idea. And we were right. Because now it costs more in gas to get there than it does to get in the theater ... and you miss all that nice fresh air. (Mission Viejo is nestled in the gentle ountains of Orange County ... the air really is fresh). And besides the theater, we have thoses fabulous recreation centers, parks, schools, shopping plazas, and a $5 million hospital. It's all part of our town, Mission Viejo. And it's all yours when you live here ...

                    "Black and white photograph of an advertisement for the city of Mission Viejo and its residential housing developments. The illustration is a photograph of a man and woman standing in front of a movie marquee at Cinema Viejo movie theater. The man is straddling the driver's seat of a tandem bicycle and looking at the woman who is standing next to him and has her arm propped on his shoulder while looking at a sheet of paper that she's holding. The marquee reads, \"Ben Gazzara, Ernest Borgnine, Neptune Factor, PG, Battle for the Planet of the Apes.\" There is also a thumbnail map in the lower right corner of the advertisement that shows the location of Mission Viejo with respect to local freeways and coastal cities as well as the location of the mentioned housing developments within Mission Viejo. The text of the advertisement reads, \"Ride your bike to Saturday night. Mission Viejo, where \"home\" is a \"hometown\" again. Bet you haven't done that in years ... a warm spring evening, the kids staying with some friends, nice night to take in a movie. Even better when you don't have to fight traffic, pay for parking , then walk six bloxcks. When we planned Mission Viejo, we had a feeling people liked things \"kind of close by\", so that a bike would put you right in the heart of town. A little old fashioned, maybe, but we liked the idea. And we were right. Because now it costs more in gas to get there than it does to get in the theater ... and you miss all that nice fresh air. (Mission Viejo is nestled in the gentle ountains of Orange County ... the air really is fresh). And besides the theater, we have thoses fabulous recreation centers, parks, schools, shopping plazas, and a $5 million hospital. It's all part of our town, Mission Viejo. And it's all yours when you live here ... Aliso Villas Townhomes from $24,495, New Madrid from $43,750, New Barcelona from $30,950, The Casta del Sol Active Retirement Neighborhood from $30,995, Castille from $34,200.
