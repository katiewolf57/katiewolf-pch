PCH final project

##### Project Proposal #####

This project will involve using both existing APIs and web scraping tools to collect image records from cultural heritage and science institutions. I will be using DPLA’s API (https://pro.dp.la/developers/api-codex) and NASA’s Image and Video Library API (https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#Images), as well as scraping the American Musuem of Natural History’s image collections (http://lbry-web-007.amnh.org/digital/index.php). I will be searching for content related to the plants of our solar system (including Pluto). I will then sort the results by planet and pull out relevant information about the image, including but not limited to institution that houses the image, collection or object ID, other identifying information, rights information, and then descriptive metadata. 

After this information has been compiled, I will create a visualization that allows the user to see what images are available for each planet in the solar system. The information about the image will be included along with a link to the item’s record in the appropriate digital collection. I am not quite sure what visualization tool I will use at this point. I am still looking at a few options, but most Python visualization libraries seem to focus on plotting data, rather than just attaching what are basically links to specific shapes. Right now, I am leaning towards using Turtle (https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle), as it seems relatively simple and I am new to visualization through Python.
